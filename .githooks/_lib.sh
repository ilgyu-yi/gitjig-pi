# .githooks/_lib.sh — shared prelude for the local git-hook enforcement tier.
# Every adapter (pre-commit / pre-push / commit-msg) sources this FIRST. It
# carries the tier's runtime as committed code and exposes:
#   githook_source <helper.sh> [category] — source a helper by basename.
#   githook_require <function> [category] — advisory-face guard.
#   githook_block  <category> <message>   — stderr message + best-effort
#                                            audit_log, returns non-zero.
#   safe_source / audit_log               — the two runtime primitives.
#
# This file DERIVES the two locations the tier needs (§3.2, §4.1, §4.2,
# §4.6) from ONE source the invoking environment cannot move — this file's
# own installed position: the helper directory beside it, and the record
# sink at the top of the repository these adapters are committed in. Both
# sides of the sink therefore perform one derivation rather than agreeing on
# two supplied values (§4.6). The derivation is bounded by a refusal: where
# that repository is not the one this operation runs against, the tier runs
# no check and says so on stderr, because a tier whose checks are committed
# in another repository would write its records there too, across the
# boundary §5.5 draws.
#
# The delegated interface the adapters require of the helper directory:
#   branch_guard.sh        → current_branch, is_protected_branch
#   secret_scan.sh         → scan_staged_secrets (honors a repo-root
#                            .shellsecretignore allow-list)
#   conventional_commit.sh → check_commit_subject (the
#                            `<type>(#<N>)[!]: <subject>` grammar,
#                            subject 1..72 codepoints)
# Anything missing — helper file, or a delegated function inside one — →
# no-op (advice tier): githook_require guards each delegated function after
# sourcing, so a present-but-incomplete helper degrades to allow, never to a
# false block.
#
# Every git child here reads stdin from /dev/null: the pre-push adapter's
# while-read loop over stdin is load-bearing, and a child that gulps stdin
# would silently starve it.
set -uo pipefail

# CDPATH moves the very `cd` the self-location below is built on: git hands
# the adapter a relative argv, so `dirname` yields an operand with no `./`
# prefix and `cd` searches CDPATH's entries before the cwd. Unset here,
# before the first cd, and inherited by every helper this file sources into
# its own shell.
unset CDPATH

# Two tops, both resolved PHYSICALLY (cd + pwd -P) so the comparison below
# reads real paths and never spellings.
#
# `_gh_op_top` is the repository the OPERATION runs against: git's own
# answer from the environment and cwd it handed this hook.
#
# `_gh_top` is the repository these ADAPTERS are committed in, discovered
# from `_gh_here` — the position this file was sourced from. It is the sink's
# source because the operation's top is the caller's to name and the
# adapters' position is not: git runs a hook with cwd at the work tree it was
# told to use, so `GIT_WORK_TREE=<ancestor>` on a `git commit` moves the
# operation's top to a directory the caller chose, and a sink derived from it
# lands outside the repository §5.5 bounds the shell to.
#
# The scrub is three variables measured to move THIS child's answer, each on
# its own: `GIT_DIR` makes it answer the `-C` directory itself, `GIT_WORK_TREE`
# makes it answer the directory the caller named, and `GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES`
# makes it fail outright. `GIT_DISCOVERY_ACROSS_FILESYSTEM` joins them as git's
# own documented control on how far discovery walks; it is not measured here,
# since the shape needs a mount boundary. The config-injection family is
# deliberately NOT on the list: with `GIT_DIR` unset, `core.worktree` set from
# the environment was measured not to move this answer, so unsetting it would
# be an unset with no shape behind it. `GIT_DIR` is scrubbed HERE and nowhere
# else — discovery upward from `_gh_here` is what replaces it, and every other
# git child of this hook keeps the one git supplied.

# audit_log <action> <category> [text...] — append ONE sanitized JSON
# record to the sink: control bytes stripped, backslash and double-quote
# escaped, one printf to an O_APPEND redirect. Composition holds
# unconditionally — one record is one line, and no field's content can
# close its field and open another. Delivery does not: the shell's printf
# writes through a stdio buffer, so a record larger than that buffer
# reaches the sink as several appends, and a second shell writer appending
# concurrently can land between them. Residual (§3.11), measured on darwin
# 25.6.0 / GNU bash 3.2.57 (arm64) at three concurrent writers of 200
# records each: at 200, 700 and 900 bytes of text every one of the 600 lines
# parses; at 1000, 2000 and 8000 some do not. The edge tracks THAT host's
# stdio buffer, so the figures are the host's and the rule above them is
# not. The FIELD boundary holds whatever the interleaving does: the escaping
# above keeps a fragment from opening a field it does not own — 0 crossings
# in the 3474 records that parsed across that sweep. Provenance does not — a
# torn fragment can itself parse, carrying another writer's text under this
# one's category — so a consumer of this trail cannot read parseability as
# provenance. The umask covers the
# 0600 file create only (umask 177, which is the value that yields mode
# 0600); a missing sink directory is created under umask 077 (nested
# subshell) — a dir created without its search bit would silently lose every
# later append and read. Best-effort: it never aborts a hook and always
# returns 0.
#
# The write-through refusal covers every component of the sink path that
# lies inside the shell's own namespace, each derived from the sink path
# rather than spelled by hand: the container (`.gitjig`), the state
# directory (`.gitjig/state`), and the sink file itself. Two questions are
# asked of them, because a link is not the only object that hijacks a
# write. A link at any component is another writer's target — `[ -d ]`,
# `mkdir -p` and the append alike would follow it — so the record is
# dropped. And the sink itself must be a REGULAR file if it exists at all:
# a FIFO is neither a link nor a regular file, and `>>` on a reader-less
# one blocks in open(2), which inside a pre-commit hook is `git commit`
# parked with nothing to reap it. The two directory components need no
# separate type check: `mkdir -p` fails on a non-directory at either of
# them ("File exists" at the state dir, "Not a directory" beneath the
# container) and that failure already drops the record. Components ABOVE
# the namespace (the repository top and its ancestors) are NOT guarded:
# they are not this writer's to own, and a link planted there retargets the
# whole clone, not just this trail.
#
# This function is not the sink's only writer, and the refusals above bind
# THIS one. The extension runtime appends to the same file through
# `appendAuditRecord` (.pi/extensions/gitjig/audit.ts), which opens with
# O_NOFOLLOW|O_NONBLOCK and holds the descriptor to an fstat verdict.
# Neither writer contains the other, and what each covers divides. On the
# LINK dimension this one refuses all three components of the sink path
# named above, while the TS open's O_NOFOLLOW binds the final component
# alone: a link at the container or at the state directory is followed there
# (measured: `appendAuditRecord` writes through a link at either component
# to a destination outside the repository and returns success, where this
# function drops the record). On three dimensions the TS verdict refuses
# what this one does not measure at all — a sink whose inode carries more
# than one name, a sink owned by another account, and any group or other
# mode bit. This writer appends to all three. That is this writer's
# enumerated residual (§3.11), stated here rather than closed: a shell `[ ]`
# probe cannot ask them of the descriptor it is about to write, and asking
# them of the PATH is a different question. The link checks themselves are
# probe-then-append — the shell has no O_NOFOLLOW open, so between `[ -L ]`
# and `>>` a link can be swapped in at a checked component; the TS sibling's
# guarded open closes that window at the one component it guards. The TS
# side states its own ancestor residual in that file's header (§5.5).

# githook_source <helper-basename> [audit-category] — source a helper from

#
# `exit` inside a SOURCED file terminates this shell, so a trailing
# `|| exit 0` never runs and the hook would carry the sourced file's status
# out to git — a refusal produced by machinery rather than by a check, in
# the one direction this tier promises never to take. An EXIT trap is what
# reaches that shape: `exit` inside the trap sets the shell's status, so a
# source that does not complete folds to allow like every other degradation.
# The line it prints names no CAUSE, because the trap cannot measure one:
# `$?` inside it is 0 both for a sourced `exit 0` and for a signal that
# killed the shell mid-source. It prints at all because this fold turns what
# would otherwise have been a refusal into an allow, and §3.9 forbids a
# disarmed allow that reads like an enforced one — one stderr line plus one
# audit record naming the file.
#
# The window has to know whether it is the OUTERMOST one, because a helper may
# itself call githook_source: an inner call that cleared the trap on its way
# out would leave the outer source unguarded, and an `exit` there would carry
# its status to git — a wedged hook with nothing printed.
#
# That question is answered from the shell's OWN CALL STACK, RECOMPUTED at
# each decision point rather than carried across the source. THAT is what the
# counter could not do. A counter is carried: this tier writes it before
# handing control to the helper and reads it back afterward, so anything that
# goes wrong while the helper holds control — an error path ending in `exit`,
# a non-zero return, an unbalanced nesting — leaves the count wrong for every
# window after it. Driven below its floor, the next window's arming test stops
# matching and that window opens with no trap behind it; driven above, the
# window is never closed and the trap outlives the function that armed it,
# firing at the adapter's own exit where its `exit 0` overwrites a refusal
# that already reached the record sink. A counter cannot be clamped out of
# this: clamping closes one direction and leaves the other byte-identical.
# Counting live `githook_source` frames derives the answer from what is
# actually on the stack at the moment it is asked, so no ACCIDENT during the
# source can move it.
#
# WHAT THIS FOLD IS FOR, stated so the residuals below read as decisions
# rather than gaps. The helper it absorbs is one that fails by ACCIDENT, with
# this tier's EXIT slot untouched and the shell still alive. A DELIBERATELY
# hostile helper is not this fold's object and could not be: the helpers are
# this repository's own committed files, resolved from this file's installed
# position, and planting a hostile one needs write access to `.githooks/` —
# at which point this file and the adapters are equally writable and no fold
# living inside them defends anything. Outside those terms the outcome is not
# this tier's to decide, and the fold's line and record may not run.
#
# Enumerated residuals, in place (SPEC §3.11). `FUNCNAME` is not beyond a
# determined helper's reach, and an earlier claim here that it was is
# WITHDRAWN as measured false: `unset FUNCNAME` neither refuses nor leaves an
# empty array — it strips the name's special attribute and leaves an ordinary
# assignable array, after which a helper can refill it with as many
# `githook_source` frames as it likes and force the trap to outlive its
# window. That is the forged-allow direction, reached by deliberate tampering,
# which the threat model above places outside this fold rather than inside it.
# It sits beside the standing exposure that a sourced file can redefine any
# function in this shell, this one included — `_gh_src_outermost` among them,
# which forges the same allow one step more cheaply. Neither is narrowed here;
# both stand equally over `safe_source` and `audit_log` and are the tier's
