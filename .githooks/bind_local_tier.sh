# .githooks/bind_local_tier.sh — the committed arming instrument for the
# local git-hook tier (SPEC §3.2 arming path, §4.1, §4.6, §4.7).
#
# One documented run from the repository root of a clone of this repository
# arms the committed hook chain for THAT clone. The adapters derive their own
# runtime and their delegated checks from the committed tree, so arming is
# the activation and nothing else:
#
#   1. activates `core.hooksPath` in the clone's OWN (local) config —
#      unset there gets the relative `.githooks` (resolving against each
#      worktree's own top); a value the clone itself carries is compared
#      RESOLVED (cd + pwd -P), so an equivalent spelling is a no-op and
#      only a truly different target is refused (§4.7
#      target's-choice-wins). Scope is load-bearing on both sides: the
#      activation is persistent and per-clone, so an ambient global or
#      system value neither stands in for it nor blocks it, while the final
#      verification also reads the EFFECTIVE value git actually resolves;
#   2. ensures `.gitjig/` is version-control-invisible at creation: no write
#      when `git check-ignore` already answers (the committed anchor), else
#      one line in the RESOLVED `git rev-parse --git-path info/exclude`
#      (never the literal `.git/info/exclude`, which is not a path where
#      `.git` is a gitfile) — after which git is RE-ASKED whether the path
#      is ignored, since a rule outside that file can outrank it and leave
#      the append inert;
#   3. verifies the resolved hooksPath both in the clone's own config (the
#      persistent activation landed) and in the value git resolves (the
#      committed hooks are what will fire). Success (exit 0) is reported
#      only on a verified bound state.
#
# What it refuses (non-zero, the foreign config value left byte-identical):
# a `core.hooksPath` in the clone's own config that does not resolve to the
# committed adapters, a value at a scope the local activation cannot
# outrank, a local value this git cannot read at all, and an exclusion that
# git still does not honor after the append. Re-running always heals
# states this instrument created; it never overwrites what another writer
# owns. This run writes nothing under `.gitjig/`: per-clone state there is
# data the tier's own record writer creates when it first records (§4.2).
#
# This file is not hook-named, so git never executes it (SPEC §4.1's
# inertness argument); it runs only by explicit operator invocation.

# short of "every variable git reads": the TRACE2 modifier family

# documentation and not in its manual page, so the enumeration above cannot
# reach it and this list does not carry it. Those modifiers change the FORM

    # precedence lets a rule outside this file decide the path - a `.gitignore`
    # in the work tree outranks info/exclude - and then the line just written
    # changes nothing while the run reports an invisible state root.
    #
    # Only a DEFINITE "not ignored" refuses. `check-ignore` answers 0, 1 or
    # 128; the last means it could not answer, and refusing on an unanswered
    # question would turn this fix into a block on a clone this run has no
    # evidence against.
    #
    # WHAT CAN REACH THE REFUSAL BELOW, and why the recovery is an ORDERED,
    # ITERATIVE procedure rather than a single named cause (issue #74).
    #
    # The census is derived from git's own precedence order (`git help
    # gitignore`, highest first: command-line patterns; `.gitignore` from the
    # path's directory up to the toplevel, deeper overriding higher;
    # `$GIT_COMMON_DIR/info/exclude`; `core.excludesFile`) plus the index,
    # which `check-ignore` consults unless `--no-index` is passed. Only a
    # source that can OUTRANK the line just appended reaches here:
    #
    #   1. THE INDEX - the state sink ITSELF is tracked. Git never ignores a
    #      tracked path. The condition is the sink, not the directory:
    #      `check-ignore` consults the index only for the path it is asked
    #      about, so a tracked SIBLING under `.gitjig/` leaves the sink
    #      ignored and never reaches here.
    #   2. info/exclude NEGATES ITSELF - `/.gitjig/` is already a line, so
    #      this run appended nothing, and a later `!` line in the same file
    #      wins on last-matching-pattern within one precedence level.
    #   3. A `.gitignore` UN-EXCLUDES THE DIRECTORY, in any of the spellings
    #      that match it - a trailing-slash pattern, a bare one, a glob.
    #
    # `core.excludesFile` is LOWER precedence and cannot outrank the append; a
    # `.gitignore` below an excluded directory is never consulted, since git
    # does not descend into one (which is also WHY shape 3 must un-exclude the
    # directory first); and this instrument passes no command-line pattern.
    # Those three are unreachable by construction.
    #
    # THE CAUSES COMPOSE, and that is what shapes the recovery. A clone can be
    # BOTH tracked and negated at once, and then no single act clears the arm:
    # removing the negation leaves the index, clearing the index leaves the
    # negation. Any scheme that sorts a clone into one cause and names one act
    # is therefore wrong on the overlap - measured, and the reason the message
    # below prescribes steps in order and makes the RE-RUN the termination
    # test. The re-run is what carries that weight, and it is deliberately not
    # backed here by a claim that each step always removes a cause: step 1's
    # act has one measured shape where it does not (below), and a warrant of
    # that form would have to be true of every act on every clone, which
    # nothing here establishes. What IS established is narrower and is what
    # the arms measure: the procedure terminates on every shape in an
    # enumerated space.
    #
    # THE INDEX IS ITS OWN QUESTION. `--no-index` deliberately hides the
    # index, so no `check-ignore` spelling can tell a tracked sink from a
    # negated one; asking one command about two independent things is what
    # made the earlier attempts here wrong. Step 1 asks `ls-files` instead.
    #
    # STEP 1'S ACT HAS A SECOND SHAPE, keyed by OUTCOME rather than by cause
    # (the same idiom the scan surfaces use). Where the sink's index entry
    # carries `skip-worktree` - an ordinary consequence of a clone that
    # tracked the state root and later turned on sparse checkout - a plain
    # `git rm --cached` reports the path as outside the sparse-checkout
    # definition and leaves the index UNCHANGED, so the arm is reached again
    # and the procedure loops on step 1. `--sparse` clears it. The flag is not
    # named unconditionally because it postdates git 2.36 and an unknown
    # option would make step 1 dead for every older git instead - so the
    # message keys it on what git itself prints, which is observable to the
    # operator on the shape that needs it and silent on every shape that does
    # not.
    #
    # THE DIRECTORY IS AN OPERAND in step 2. `/.gitjig/` and its negations can
    # match the DIRECTORY, so where something un-excludes it no pattern need
    # match the FILE path at all, and asking about the file alone can report
    # nothing to act on. A negative-control arm pins that.
    #
    # STEP 3 IS THE HONEST LIMIT, and its GATE is "step 2 named no `!` rule" -
    # never "step 2 printed nothing". Those differ, and the difference strands
    # an operator: a directory-only pattern (one spelled with a trailing
    # slash) cannot match a bare directory operand git cannot confirm IS a
    # directory, so where `.gitjig/` is not on disk such a negation is
    # invisible to the lookup - while an ORDINARY pattern that does match the
    # bare operand still prints. The operator then sees output naming a rule,
    # none of it a negation, and a step 3 gated on silence would shut them
    # out with the real cause unnamed. Gating on the absence of a `!` rule
    # covers both, so the acts are exhaustive over what step 2 can print.
    #
    # What step 3 gives is a bounded PLACE to look rather than a rule, and the
    # census is what bounds it: only those files can outrank the exclusion.
    #
    # The issue-#74 arms in `test/bind-instrument.githook.test.ts` measure
    # this, including one that enumerates a shape space over the axes named
    # above - the negation's spelling and location, whether `.gitjig/` is on
    # disk, whether the sink is tracked, and what competing ordinary pattern
    # is present - runs this procedure on each shape that reaches the arm, and
    # requires it to terminate with the sink ignored. That space is a
    # constructed sample, not an exhaustive one: what it establishes is that
    # the procedure terminates on every shape it contains.
