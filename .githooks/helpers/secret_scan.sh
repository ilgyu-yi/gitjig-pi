# .githooks/helpers/secret_scan.sh — the staged-secret class's delegated
# scan (SPEC §3.3 secret row + staged-scan semantics statement; the
# interface contract `.githooks/_lib.sh` states for this file). Sourced by
# adapters, never executed; defines:
#   scan_staged_secrets
#
# Rule source: the committed pattern file `secret-patterns`, resolved from
# THIS file's own installed position (`BASH_SOURCE[0]`, inside the function,
# so the derivation stays function-local) — the bytes both readers must
# agree on are the committed repo file (§3.3's single-source rule), and the
# rule set travels with the helper set the adapters actually sourced rather
# than with a directory name spelled against the repository top. Format and
# the compatible-extension-only rule live in that file's header.
#
# Measurement domain (§3.3): the added text lines of the staged diff, per
# staged path — paths from `git diff --cached --name-only -z`, each then
# addressed with a `:(literal)` pathspec; content read config-neutrally
# (`--no-ext-diff --no-textconv --no-color -U0`) and env-neutrally (the
# pathspec-magic env family is unset around every git-diff child — see
# _gitjig_ss_git_diff); added lines identified
# structurally from the diff's own hunk shape (a content line beginning
# `++` is content, not a header). Binary is keyed by the numstat
# no-line-counts outcome, never a prose message (§3.10). The first commit
# of an unborn HEAD diffs against the empty tree, keyed by outcome. The
# matcher is the hook interpreter's own ERE engine (`[[ =~ ]]`) under
# LC_ALL=C byte semantics — no PATH-resolved external matcher enters the
# verdict path.
#
# Outcomes (§3.3's three-disposition split under §3.9):
#   - machinery degradation (pattern file absent/unreadable, an up-front
#     pattern-validation failure, a set empty after stripping) → the scan
#     disarms for the run with exactly one not-enforced audit warn record
#     and allows — never a refusal of the actor's input;
#   - unmeasurable input (binary by the numstat outcome, unrenderable
#     staged content, an empty per-path measurement for a path the
#     enumeration itself listed, a matcher failure at scan time over one
#     input) → refused on its own content-free cause, distinct from a
#     pattern match;
#   - pattern match → refused; the record carries the pattern ID and the
#     SANITIZED path and never the matched bytes or raw path bytes (§3.8).
#
# Path sanitization (stated choice): every byte outside printable ASCII,
# plus '%' itself and the single quote (the record's own path-field
# delimiter), is percent-encoded (%XX, uppercase hex) before the path
# reaches any record sink — `githook_block` and `audit_log` interpolate
# raw, and a hostile filename must not split a record or forge its fields.
#
# Allow-list: the repo-root `.shellsecretignore` is domain exclusion, never
# approval — literal or shell-glob lines, `#` comments, absent means empty;
# a present-but-unreadable list emits one degradation warn record and the
# scan proceeds with NO exclusions (it fails to excuse; it never approves
# unmeasured). Suppression by a line that MATCHES is silent on every
# surface, including a `*` line that excludes every staged path: the
# machinery degradations above print because nobody chose them, and this
# list is the operator's own working-tree choice, tracked or not — a record
# per suppressed path would be one per commit per path on any repository
# with a broad list.
#
# This file emits the CAUSE only; each calling surface appends the recovery
# live at that surface (§3.11's arm-scoped remediation). Every git child
# reads stdin from /dev/null (the adapter loop precedent). Fail-direction
# bookkeeping lives in the one inventory at
# `.pi/extensions/gitjig/postures.ts`, never re-decided here.
#
# Env-trust note (the branch_guard.sh `unset -v` precedent): this file
# keeps NO file-scope `_GITJIG_SS_*` state — every variable below is
# function-local, so there is no inherited cell for a caller's environment
# to pre-seed and nothing to discard at source time.
