# .githooks/helpers/branch_guard.sh — the protected-branch class's
# delegated predicate (SPEC §3.3 row + ref-identity semantics statement;
# the interface contract `.githooks/_lib.sh` states for this file). Sourced
# by adapters, never executed; defines:
#   current_branch
#   is_protected_branch <target-refname-with-refs/heads/-stripped>
#
# Rule source: ONE derived identity P (§3.3), derived in two stages and
# cached per hook invocation so a multi-ref push pays one derivation.
# Stage 1 reads the local pointer (`git symbolic-ref -q
# refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`, prefix stripped). Stage 2 — only where stage 1
# fails — measures the remote's advertised default (`git ls-remote --symref
# origin HEAD`, terminal prompts disabled), a measurement, never a guess
# (§3.9's loader rule). Stage 2 is keyed on the executing script's own
# name (`$0` basename `pre-push`) — a name, not the installed hook — so a
# caller whose basename is anything else, the commit surface included,
# never opens a network connection, while a caller NAMED `pre-push` gains
# stage 2 (§3.3's reachability clause; the keying's residuals run both
# ways: renamed away loses stage 2, named into it gains only a read the
# caller could run directly). Stage-2 failure is keyed by outcome (§3.10):
# non-zero exit, or empty/unparseable output — a dangling remote HEAD
# yields empty output with exit 0.
#
# Where both stages fail, P is underivable: the gate is DISARMED for the
# run and says so plainly — exactly one audit warn record stating the gate
# is not enforced (§3.9's degradation-signal rule), then every call answers
# "not protected" so the adapter allows. Machinery degradation, never a
# refusal of the actor's input.
#
# With P in hand the boundary is total (§3.3's four dispositions):
# byte-equal to P → protected (refuse); ASCII-case-fold-equal but
# byte-unequal → protected under §3.9's unverifiable-destination clause,
# with its own distinct cause; anything else → not P → allow (new branches,
# tags, every other ref). Folding is ASCII-only under byte semantics
# (LC_ALL=C tr), per the SPEC statement's enumerated residuals.
#
# Causes are content-free constants (§3.9): the arm name only, never the
# target refname's bytes — neither on stderr nor in any audit record
# (`githook_block` interpolates raw, and a hostile refname must reach no
# surface; §3.11's hostile-arm terseness). This file emits the CAUSE only;
# each calling surface appends the recovery live at that surface (§3.11's
# arm-scoped remediation).
#
# Fail direction bookkeeping: the two refusals below are the LIVE predicate
# refusing the actor's own input (§3.9's measurement rule). Degradation of
# the chain around this file — binding, helper file, delegated function,
# derivation — is inventoried at `.pi/extensions/gitjig/postures.ts`, never
# re-decided here. Every git call reads stdin from /dev/null: the pre-push
# adapter's while-read loop over stdin is load-bearing, and a child that
# gulps stdin would silently starve it.

# The derivation cache is process state, never inherited state: git hands
# the pusher's environment to hooks, so an exported _GITJIG_BG_* pair could
# otherwise pre-seed the verdict (a traceless disarm, a decoy identity, or
# a set -u abort). Sourcing precedes every call, so discarding inherited
# values here preserves the per-invocation cache while closing the seed.

# current_branch — total function (§3.9): prints the branch's own name, or
# prints nothing and fails — no consumer reads an unvalidated value.
#
# The FULL refname is read and one `refs/heads/` prefix stripped, never
# `--short`. `--short` prints the shortest UNAMBIGUOUS spelling, which is a
# property of what else lives under `refs/` rather than of the branch: one
# `git tag <P>` makes it print `heads/<P>`, which compares unequal to P on
# both the byte-equal and the ASCII-fold arm and answers not-P — a traceless
# disarm of this arm, one innocuous command away. A HEAD resolving outside
# `refs/heads/` has no branch name and fails here rather than being reported
# under a spelling that is not its identity. This mirrors how the identity P
# itself is derived below: full refname, one prefix stripped.
