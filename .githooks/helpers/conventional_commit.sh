# .githooks/helpers/conventional_commit.sh — the commit-format class's
# delegated predicate (SPEC §3.3 `commit-format` row; the grammar contract
# `.githooks/_lib.sh` states for this file). Sourced by adapters, never
# executed; defines:
#   check_commit_subject <subject-line>
#
# Grammar: `<type>(#<N>)[!]: <subject>` — the required group
# feat|fix|docs|refactor|perf demands `(#N)`; the optional group
# test|style|build|ci|chore|revert may omit it. The subject after `: ` must
# measure 1..72 codepoints.
#
# Measurement is a total function with exactly two outcomes (§3.9): a valid
# decimal, or a refusal — no consumer reads an unvalidated value. The domain
# is validated BEFORE counting: pure-ASCII input is exact in any charmap
# (codepoints == bytes), so a degraded environment refuses only the inputs
# it would mis-measure; non-ASCII input needs a UTF-8 measuring
# charmap (the locale's, verified — a byte count over multibyte input is a
# confident wrong decimal, not a measurement) AND bytes valid in that
# charmap (invalid bytes have no codepoint count). Either miss refuses with
# its own arm-named cause.
#
# Causes are content-free constants (§3.9): the arm name plus the measured
# decimal where one exists, never the subject's bytes — `githook_block`
# interpolates raw, and a hostile subject must reach no surface (§3.11's
# hostile-arm terseness). This file emits the CAUSE only; each calling
# surface appends the recovery live at that surface (§3.11's arm-scoped
# remediation — the division `.githooks/commit-msg` states in place).
#
# Fail direction bookkeeping: every refusal below is the LIVE predicate
# refusing the actor's own input (§3.9's measurement rule). Degradation of
# the enforcement chain around this file — binding, helper file, delegated
# function — is the adapters' fail-open business (`githook_source`,
# `githook_require`), inventoried at `.pi/extensions/gitjig/postures.ts`,
# never re-decided here.

# Parsing runs under byte semantics (LC_ALL=C) so globs, lengths, and
# offsets are deterministic over arbitrary bytes — a subject may carry any
# byte, and multibyte-aware bash string ops are undefined over invalid
# sequences. The caller's charmap is captured FIRST: it is the measuring
# charmap the domain check consults, and forcing C would erase it.
