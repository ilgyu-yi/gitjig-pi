/**
 * Integration suite for the session-start bind advisory of a tier that
 * derives its own locations (issue #68's amended AC5; SPEC §5.2's advisory
 * state set and §5.9's read-only detector rule).
 *
 * The state set measured here is read from the DOC, not from the
 * classifier's current tokens, because the classifier is what this change
 * moves. The three sentences it implements:
 *
 *   - "a clone whose effective hooks path does not resolve to this
 *     repository's committed adapters surfaces one such line, naming the
 *     state and the exact re-arm command" — including a hooks path this
 *     repository's instrument did not configure, "classified degraded
 *     rather than argued with";
 *   - a clone whose effective hooks path DOES resolve to them surfaces
 *     none;
 *   - "A helper set the adapters cannot resolve is not a session-start
 *     state at all: it surfaces where it degrades, at the enforcement
 *     surface."
 *
 * Drives real `pi` sessions through the hermetic harness (seam-rooted
 * state, §5.5) against the gitjig runtime linked from THIS repository's
 * tree. Each fixture root is made a git repository carrying a copy of the
 * committed `.githooks/` tree and shaped into one binding state; the suite
 * then reads the session JSONL for the advisory entry type the runtime
 * exports.
 *
 * ANTI-VACUITY. Two of the three arms assert SILENCE, which a session where
 * the extension never loaded satisfies by itself — so every arm opens with
 * `requireRuntimeLoaded`, which demands this fixture's session carry the
 * extension's own registration entry.
 *
 * POSIX substrate only: the suite skips on win32.
