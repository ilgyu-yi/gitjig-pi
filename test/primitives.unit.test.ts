/**
 * Unit suite for the tier-1 runtime primitives (issue #32).
 *
 * Imports the runtime modules from this repository's `.pi/extensions/gitjig/`
 * tree directly. Contracts under test:
 *
 *   - audit.ts    — one JSON object per line; free text encoded at write
 *                   time so embedded newlines/control characters never
 *                   split a record (§5.5); append to a missing destination
 *                   fails open without throwing (§3.9 posture row); the
 *                   sink is the path the consuming gate reads and nothing
 *                   else (§4.6), readable only by the account that writes
 *                   it (§5.5), and its degradation signal names a recovery
 *                   that is live where it is emitted — one per object to
 *                   repair, never one clause shared across objects that
 *                   owe different acts (§3.11). The write itself never
 *                   returns having landed only part of a record, measured
 *                   at the seam the append calls (§3.12). A state root
 *                   that is not absolute is refused rather than resolved
 *                   against the process working directory, which would
 *                   put the trail outside the repository it is about and
 *                   report success (§4.6, §5.5).
 *   - state-root.ts — resolution matrix: no seam → operational path
 *                   computed, nothing created; seam → override with
 *                   `seamActive: true`; malformed/unusable seam → refusal,
 *                   never a fallback to the operational sink (§5.5, §3.9).
 *   - locate.ts   — self-location from the installed module path: cwd-
 *                   independent for every entry (§4.6), immune to decoy
 *                   ambient variables (§4.6), bounded below by the install
 *                   root — decided component-wise, so a directory whose
 *                   name merely shares a prefix with the traversal token
 *                   is bounded like any other (§4.6, §4.7) — and answering
 *                   rather than throwing when the filesystem refuses a
 *                   probe (§3.9 `repo-root-discovery`).
 *   - postures.ts — the §3.9 fail-posture inventory: exactly the shipped
 *                   enforcement-layer rows, each keyed on a failure shape
 *                   with a posture, and every fail-closed row with an
 *                   in-place justification.
 *
 * One arm measures this suite rather than the runtime: the containment
 * guard the recovery arms perform behind is itself asserted, because a
 * guard nothing measures is decoration (§3.12) and this one is what
 * stands between a mutated clause and an act on the host.

	 * temporary directory carries whitespace.
	 *
	 * The shell decode does not undo the `\uXXXX` escaping both styles
	 * apply to control and bidi classes; no path these arms construct
	 * carries one, and a clause that named such a path would fail the arm
	 * loudly rather than silently mis-decode.
	 *
	 * THE INVARIANT THIS BRANCH DEPENDS ON, stated so a later author writing
	 * clause prose knows it: no clause carries a single or double quote in
	 * its prose AHEAD of its operand. Every apostrophe that exists today —
	 * `this account's quota`, `another account's file` — sits after it. A
	 * clause that broke this would silently flip the branch and yield a
