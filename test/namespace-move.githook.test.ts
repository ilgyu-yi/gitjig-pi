/**
 * Behavioral arm for the local tier across the namespace move (issue #75).
 *
 * Subject under test: the COMMITTED local-tier chain — this repository's
 * `.githooks/pre-commit` + `.githooks/_lib.sh` + `.githooks/helpers/` —
 * copied byte-for-byte into a disposable clone by `harness/githook-fixture.ts`
 * and driven only through `git commit`, exactly as `secret-scan.githook.test.ts`
 * drives it. Nothing here calls a predicate directly.
 *
 * THE QUESTION. The rename moves the shell's per-clone untracked state
 * namespace (SPEC §2.5's two-namespace rule; §3.2's derived sink). A clone
 * armed BEFORE that move keeps whatever `core.hooksPath` arming wrote — it
 * is a per-clone config value, not committed bytes, so the move cannot
 * rewrite it and no operator is going to re-run the bind instrument in every
 * existing clone. The tier must therefore cross the move without a re-arm:
 * still enforcing, recording into the NEW sink, with the stored binding
 * untouched. This suite is that one arm.
 *
 * Three things are asserted about one measured commit, in this order:
 *
 *   1. ENFORCEMENT SURVIVED — the staged secret is still refused. If the
 *      move made the tier inert, this fails first and the other two
 *      assertions would be measuring a chain that decided nothing. Keyed on
 *      the refusal's own observables (non-zero status + the adapter's live
 *      recovery line + the pattern ID on stderr), never on the record sink,
 *      because the sink is what the next assertion is ABOUT.
 *   2. THE SINK FOLLOWS THE NAMESPACE — the refusal record lands at
 *      `<top>/.gitjig/state/audit.jsonl`. A tier whose records stop
 *      following its own container writes them where nothing reads.
 *   3. NO RE-ARM WAS REQUIRED — the clone's stored `core.hooksPath` is
 *      byte-identical to what arming set, before and after the measured
 *      commit. A tier that survives the move by silently rewriting the
 *      operator's config has not survived it; neither has one that needs
 *      the instrument re-run.
 *
 * WHY THE SINK PATH IS SPELLED HERE AND NOT READ FROM THE HARNESS.
 * `buildGithookFixture` exposes a `auditFile` field, and that field tracks
 * whichever container the tree currently uses. Asserting through it would
 * make this arm agree with the implementation by construction — it would be
 * green today AND after, measuring nothing. The contract path is written out
 * literally instead, from SPEC §2.5, so the assertion can disagree with the
 * tree. Only the file NAME is imported, from the harness constant.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH. It measures one adapter (pre-commit)
 * on one refusal class (staged secret). It does not establish that the push
 * or commit-msg adapters moved their sink, that the tier-1 extension moved
 * its state root, or that the OLD container is no longer written — that last
 * one is the closure check's job (`name-retirement.structure.test.ts`), not
 * a behavioural arm's.
 *
 * Environment constraints, following the sibling suite: the planted secret
 * is BUILT AT RUNTIME from codepoint constants and never written literally
 * (a literal secret-shaped string here would trip the development shell's
 * own staged-secret matcher when this file is committed, and then this
 * repository's armed hook). POSIX substrate only: skips on win32.
