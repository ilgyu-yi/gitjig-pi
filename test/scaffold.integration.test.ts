/**
 * Integration suite for the tier-1 runtime scaffold (issue #32 ACs).
 *
 * Drives real `pi` sessions through the hermetic harness against the gitjig
 * extension loaded from THIS repository's tree (fixture symlinks
 * `.pi/extensions/gitjig.ts` + `.pi/extensions/gitjig/`). Pinned runtime
 * surface:
 *
 *   - audit records (one JSON object per line in `<seam>/audit.jsonl`)
 *     with `action` markers ordered `ext-load` → `session-start`, plus a
 *     `seam-active` announcement when the test seam is active (§4.6, §5.5);
 *   - a post-session_start session entry `customType: "gitjig-registration"`
 *     with `data: { repoRoot, stateRoot, seamActive, auditWritable }` (§5.9;
 *     spike: appendEntry is an action method, legal only after
 *     session_start), reported two-sided: `true` on a live sink and `false`
 *     on a dead one, so the derivation is pinned and not just the field;
 *   - the fail-closed `seam-target` posture end to end: a seam that is set
 *     but unusable refuses the run and names its own recovery, reached
 *     through the harness's explicit `seamOverride` opt-in (§3.9, §3.11);
 *   - the harness's own seam integrity: `RunOptions.env` cannot replace
 *     `GITJIG_TEST_STATE_ROOT`, so nothing but an explicit opt-in moves a
 *     run's state root (§4.6);
 *   - no action method at extension load, checked against the D1-calibrated
 *     failure class (§3.2; §3.9 refuse-not-approve);
 *   - D2 tree isolation: `git status --porcelain` identical before/after,
 *     and the operational state root `<repo>/.gitjig/state/` in the same
 *     state after the suite as before it — same absence, or the same
 *     entries at the same sizes, so a suite appending into a trail that
 *     already existed is caught too and not only one adding a file, which
 *     `/.gitjig/` being git-ignored keeps out of the porcelain arm (§5.5 —
 *     the seam, never the operational sink). The
 *     assertion targets `.gitjig/state/` rather than all of `.gitjig/` because
 *     `.gitjig/` legitimately holds per-clone untracked state in a working
 *     clone (§4.1); the runtime's own sink is what must stay untouched.
 *   - polluted-ambient re-run: byte-identical resolution and zero writes
 *     into a decoy tree (§4.6), under a positive control that the decoy
 *     variables reached the child process — without it the block would pass
 *     just as well on a run that was never polluted.
