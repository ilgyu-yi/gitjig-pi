/**
 * Unit suite for the changelog fragment-gate predicate (issue #43).
 *
 * Subject under test: `.github/workflows/check-changelog.sh`, the gate body
 * the `fragment-gate` job calls. It is driven here entirely through its two
 * seams — the PR file listing on stdin and the fragment tree at `--root` —
 * so the suite needs no network, no `gh`, and no `pi`.
 *
 * Invocation contract:
 *
 *   printf '%s' "$FILES_JSON" | bash check-changelog.sh \
 *     --pr <n> --expected-count <n> --allowed "<stems>" --root <dir>
 *
 * stdin is the shape `gh api --paginate --slurp .../pulls/N/files` produces:
 * an array of pages, each page an array of file objects (flatten `.[][]`).
 * Exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = block; no third code is in the contract.
 *
 * The predicate under test is SPEC §1.3's one sentence — "CI enforces the
 * floor — at least one valid in-allow-set fragment or the skip label, with
 * every added fragment valid" — where `added` qualifies only the second
 * clause. It therefore has two independent clauses over the NET file listing:
 *
 *   Clause 1 (existential floor, permissive). At least one entry whose
 *     status is not `removed`, whose path matches the fragment shape, whose
 *     stem is in the allow-set, and whose content is valid. A fragment that
 *     fails clause 1 is merely not a witness — failing it is never itself a
 *     reason to block.
 *   Clause 2 (universal, no-junk). Every `added`/`renamed`/`copied` entry
 *     matching the fragment shape is valid. One valid fragment never excuses
 *     a malformed sibling. A re-categorising move — an `added` stem that also
 *     appears among the listing's `removed` fragment stems, or a `renamed`
 *     entry from one fragment path to another leaving the stem unchanged — is
 *     exempt from the allow-set rule ALONE, because that stem was in the
 *     allow-set of the PR that first added the fragment. Every other rule
 *     keeps running on it.
 *
 * Three fail-closed arms run before either clause and must stay
 * distinguishable from clause 1, so a transport-shaped failure is never
 * reported as "the author forgot a fragment": a payload the gate read no
 * entries from at all, a flattened length that disagrees with
 * `--expected-count` (truncation), and a `status` outside the known set.
 *
 * Fragment validity is the pre-existing contract of
 * `changelog_unreleased/TEMPLATE.md`: positive-integer stem with no leading
 * zero, a line matching `^- `, that same line carrying `(#<stem>)`, and the
 * stem in the allow-set.
 *
 * Every fixture lives under `tmpdir()`. The harness asserts `git status
 * --porcelain` is byte-identical across the suite (`harness/run-pi.ts`), so a
 * fixture written into the repository tree would red an unrelated suite.
 *
 * Issue #49 names five single-edit weakenings of the script; this file
 * carries exactly five killers, one per weakening, each marked at its site
 * with the weakening number it kills: 1 → T27, 2 → S1, 3 → T28, 4 → T7's
 * enum-extension assertion, 5 → T9's summary assertion. T26, the zero-entry
 * listing, is a fixture for a shape the gate must classify, not a mutant
 * killer.
