/**
 * Hermetic pi integration suite for the command spine (issue #91; SPEC
 * §4.8 "The command layer" — the governed-home conjunct, the four-rung
 * surface rule, the uniqueness obligation; §4.9 for the dispatcher the
 * `review` command rides as one more call site).
 *
 * Every spine arm is RED until the Code phase lands the three assets —
 * `work-on` at `.pi/prompts/work-on.md`, `review` and `ship` as extension
 * commands registered from the gitjig entry — and each arm's first
 * assertion is authored to fail on exactly that absence: a missing
 * registration row, a missing session entry, a missing template file.
 * The route arms (headless command dispatch; the registration dump) and
 * the collision-mutant arms are green on this tree by design.
 *
 * REGISTRATION PROOF (AC 1–2). One session over a fixture that mirrors
 * the deployed layout — the committed runtime, prompts dir, and skills
 * dir symlinked in (`linkGitjigRuntime`/`linkPromptsDir`/`linkSkillsDir`;
 * dangling links are legal, the harness header owns that contract) — with
 * a probe extension that dumps every `pi.getCommands()` row at
 * `session_start` (§4.8's own measured instrument shape). The arms read
 * `name`/`source`/`sourceInfo.scope`/`sourceInfo.baseDir` from the
 * substrate's report and never infer ownership from a filename or a path
 * walk (§4.8's canonical-name rule). A governed-home row is one whose
 * `scope` is `project` AND whose `baseDir` is the fixture's `.pi`
 * (accepted under both the raw and the realpath spelling of the OS temp
 * root). Uniqueness is full-row-multiset equality of the governed-home
 * rows against the exact expected set; within the governed-home filter a
 * row's free cells are `name` and `source`, so the multiset is over those
 * pairs. Two collision-mutant fixtures prove the equality arm's teeth in
 * both directions — an extra extension registering `work-on`, and a
 * prompt-side `review.md` — each asserting the DETECTION: the poison row
 * is reported by the substrate AND the multiset differs from the expected
 * set. INVERSION: those two arms are green exactly when the matcher has
 * teeth, on this tree and after Code alike; a red there means the
 * substrate silently deduped that collision cell (§4.8's recorded
 * contingency — record, not patch).
 *
 * RUNG-1 ACTS (AC 3). A probe-first arm re-verifies the headless route in
 * suite: a throwaway registered command (`zz-probe`, its own fixture so it
 * adds no governed-home row to the registration fixture) is invoked via a
 * print-mode `/zz-probe <args>` prompt and must land its args in a file —
 * green now, so a spine arm's red can never be this route's defect. The
 * `review` round trip then runs against a git-inited caller fixture
 * carrying the runtime as COPIED bytes (the runtime resolves its repo
 * root by realpath, so symlinks would escape the fixture — the sibling
 * dispatch suite's measured ground) and a committed delegate script that
 * writes the bounded return; the delegate is a plain shell script, not a
 * child pi session — the delegate's child-session shape is the sibling
 * suite's subject, not re-proven here.
 *
 * AUTHORED PHASE-C CONTRACT (what the arms bind):
 *   - `review` is an extension command registered from the gitjig entry;
 *     its argument string is `[timeoutMs=<n>] <expectedRef> <delegateArgv…>`,
 *     whitespace-split, the leading bound optional and recognized in FIRST
 *     POSITION ONLY (issue #94); the handler dispatches through the ONE
 *     dispatcher (§4.9's
 *     one home, many call sites) and appends a session entry
 *     `customType: "gitjig-review"` whose data carries the disposition,
 *     the compare VALIDITY token (`confirmed`/`invalid`), and the admitted
 *     summary — never an operand; the dispatch acts land
 *     `"category":"dispatch"` audit records through the landed writer,
 *     the admission carrying `"action":"admitted"`.
 *   - `ship` is an extension command registered from the gitjig entry; it
 *     performs no merge and reaches no network; its registered
 *     `description` names the three offline undecidables — the
 *     platform-held review verdict, the platform-held AC state, and the
 *     merge act; on invocation it appends a session entry
 *     `customType: "gitjig-ship"` whose data carries a `composition`
 *     token, `"satisfied"` or `"unsatisfied"`. Both directions of the
 *     report shape are bound: a fact-less invocation composes
 *     `"unsatisfied"`, and an invocation supplying the landed fact
 *     grammar (`verdict-head=<the caller repo's real head> ac=closed`)
 *     composes `"satisfied"` — the satisfied run over its own caller
 *     fixture, because the ship anchor asserts exactly one `gitjig-ship`
 *     entry per fixture.
 *
 * TEMPLATE NORMS (AC 4). A lexical read of `.pi/prompts/work-on.md`'s
 * committed bytes: the issue-first-entry token (§1.1's standard flow) and
 * the Doc → Test → Code work-order pointer (§1.2) must be present.
 * "Points at the SPEC sections, not restated prose" is a review judgment
 * (§2.8) the lexical arm does NOT establish — disclosed at the arm.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH. The uniqueness arm binds the three
 * `.pi/` surfaces the fixture mirrors; a project-skill home outside
 * `.pi/` (none exists in this repository) is outside the governed-home
 * filter by the conjunct's own `baseDir` limb. The operand sweep is
 * LEXICAL — case-folded hex runs held against the held operand on the
 * dispatcher's own rule: containment from the runtime's exported floor,
 * the held 7-prefix at any length (issue #104) — over each caller fixture's
 * session entries, audit trail, and run output; a paraphrased or
 * re-encoded operand is §4.9's injectable-context residual. A green
 * `review` round trip says nothing about any delegate's quality: the
 * delegate is a fixed echo of the bounded-return shape.
