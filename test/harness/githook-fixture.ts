/**
 * Shared git-hook fixture builder (issue #55; reusable by sibling suites).
 *
 * Builds a disposable git repository that exercises the committed local-tier
 * chain exactly as a bound clone runs it:
 *
 *   - THIS repository's `.githooks/` tree is copied into the fixture at the
 *     SAME relative path, and the copy is verified byte-for-byte against the
 *     source before any arm runs — a fixture that re-arranges or edits the
 *     layout can go green while the real checkout stays inert, so the
 *     builder refuses to hand out a divergent copy;
 *   - `core.hooksPath` is set to `.githooks`, which is the whole binding a
 *     governed clone carries (§3.2): the adapters derive their helper
 *     directory from their own installed position and their record sink
 *     from the repository top, so the fixture writes nothing under
 *     `.gitjig/` and a degradation arm mutates the fixture's own
 *     `.githooks/helpers` — the layout every deployment runs.
 *
 * Every check drives `git commit` through this fixture, never a predicate
 * function directly, so the arms measure the chain an operator actually
 * runs: `_lib.sh` → helper dir → predicate → block.
 *
 * The commit environment is CONSTRUCTED, never inherited wholesale: PATH is
 * passed through (git and bash must resolve), HOME is fixture-local,
 * gitconfig is repo-local only (`GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM`), terminal prompts are
 * disabled (`GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0` — no fixture operation may wait on a
 * credential prompt), and the locale is pinned to a multibyte-capable
 * charmap (`en_US.UTF-8`) so codepoint measurement has a defined baseline;
 * an arm that needs a degraded measurement environment overrides the locale
 * explicitly on its own commit. POSIX substrate only: suites that use this
 * builder skip on win32.
 *
 * PUSH SUBSTRATE (issue #59). The `remote` option adds a fixture-local bare
 * remote named `origin`, so push-shaped arms can drive `git push` through
 * the committed `pre-push` adapter against a real receive end:
 *
 *   - `git init --bare` + `git remote add origin <path>` + one initial push
 *     of the default branch, then `git remote set-head origin <name>` — in
 *     that order, because `set-head` refuses until the tracking ref the
 *     push creates exists (`git remote add` alone never writes
 *     `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD`);
 *   - `omitHeadPointer` skips the `set-head` step, leaving
 *     `refs/remotes/origin/HEAD` absent — the clone-configuration shape a
 *     manually-added remote carries (derivation-failure arms);
 *   - `danglingRemoteHead` points the bare remote's own HEAD at a branch
 *     that does not exist, after the initial push: `git ls-remote --symref
 *     origin HEAD` then yields empty output with exit 0 — the
 *     stage-2-failure shape keyed by outcome, not cause;
 *   - the setup commit and setup push run with `--no-verify`: fixture
 *     construction is substrate, never a measurement, and must not depend
 *     on the chain state the arms are about to measure.
