/**
 * Shared secret-pattern conformance case set (issue #83 AC4; SPEC §3.3's
 * egress rule-source clause). This module is the convergence lock §3.11's
 * converged-implementations clause asks for: the two readers of the one
 * committed pattern file — the tier-2 bash scanner (`scan_staged_secrets`)
 * and the egress consumer (`.pi/extensions/gitjig/publish/scan.ts`) —
 * cannot literally share code, so both are run against THIS one case set
 * by `test/egress-conformance.unit.test.ts`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES NOT ESTABLISH. It is data plus a parser of the
 * committed pattern file — it runs no reader and proves nothing by itself.
 * A case's `tier2`/`egress` fields are EXPECTED dispositions; the suites
 * that drive each reader are what turn them into claims. The per-reader
 * divergences recorded here are the SPEC's own (§3.3): they are deliberate
 * and enumerated, so agreement between the readers is asserted everywhere
 * EXCEPT where a case declares the divergence.
 *
 * Environment constraint (the secret-scan.githook.test.ts precedent):
 * every secret-shaped fragment and every control byte is BUILT AT RUNTIME
 * from codepoint constants and concatenation, never written literally — a
 * literal secret-shaped string in this source would trip the development
 * shell's own staged-secret matcher the moment this file is committed, and
 * a literal control byte cannot ride a Bash command inline (measured; the
 * issue #83 probes). The asserted sequences exist only at
 * runtime, which also keeps byte-absence assertions honest.
 *
 * Divergence table pinned by the body-measurement cases (SPEC §3.3):
 *   - NUL past git's binary-sniff window: tier-2 strips the NUL at the
 *     hook's line read and the JOINED fragments over-match (refuse-match —
 *     measured 2026-09-05 against the committed chain; a truncating read
 *     would flip this to allow), while the egress reading refuses the
 *     whole body out-of-domain.
 *   - NUL inside the sniff window: tier-2 refuses on the unmeasurable
 *     (binary) outcome with no pattern ID; egress refuses out-of-domain —
 *     the corresponding content-free refusal, an agreement in effect.
 *   - Cf-split (U+200B inside the matched span): tier-2 ALLOWS — its
 *     recorded residual, #39's to close — while egress strips Cf before
 *     matching and refuses naming the pattern.
 *   - Multibyte interruption (é inside the counted class run) and a
 *     CRLF-terminated secret line: the readers AGREE (allow/clean and
 *     refuse/refuse respectively) — convergence pins, not divergences.
