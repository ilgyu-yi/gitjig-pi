/**
 * Structural suite for the command-layer section (issue #78, Directive #77;
 * SPEC §4.8 "The command layer" and the sites amended to point at it — the
 * subset this suite binds is the one arms 3–6 name).
 *
 * Subject under test: the TEXT of `SPEC.md`. The change under test appends
 * `### 4.8 The command layer` after §4.7 and amends the sites whose
 * obligations currently dangle on an object no section defines. Seven arms:
 *
 *   1. a `### 4.8 ` heading exists;
 *   2. §4.8 has a row in the generated table of contents;
 *   3. §3.4's body carries a §4.8 cross-reference (issue #78's AC names
 *      this arm by name);
 *   4. §3.2's tier-1 paragraph — the one that says extensions "can register
 *      commands" — carries a §4.8 pointer;
 *   5. §4.1's `.pi/` paragraph carries a §4.8 pointer;
 *   6. §4's intro paragraph enumerates §4.8 alongside its siblings;
 *   7. the §4.8 span records a measurement against a NAMED substrate version
 *      (issue #78's signal-3 criterion: the recorded measurement is that
 *      criterion's checkable residue, §2.4).
 *
 * A structural check over a prose file is the sanctioned shape here, not a
 * workaround: §2.5 — "Structural checks over prose files remain normal
 * tests." The arms are lexical scans over `SPEC.md`'s bytes; they run no
 * `pi`, build no fixture, and reach no network.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH (§3.11: "A report-only check names the
 * property it does not establish, so a green report is never read as the
 * missing guarantee"). Every claim below is LEXICAL — about prose text —
 * and none is a claim about a live command layer. Specifically, a green run
 * does NOT establish:
 *
 *   1. That any command asset exists. Nothing here reads `.pi/`, and issue
 *      #78 puts authoring one out of scope; §4.8 can be fully green with the
 *      layer entirely unbuilt.
 *   2. That the surface-selection rule §4.8 states is CORRECT, COMPLETE, or
 *      USABLE — that it really returns one surface per required capability,
 *      that the substrate really offers the surfaces it names, or that its
 *      worked cases resolve. Those are judgments at review (§2.3), not
 *      properties of a matcher over text.
 *   3. That the recorded measurement is CURRENT. Arm 7 asserts the PRESENCE
 *      and SHAPE of a substrate-version token, never equality against the
 *      installed `pi --version`: a clone carrying a newer substrate would
 *      red on an equality arm with no defect present, and §3.12 rules that
 *      "a check that can false-red is a defect". Drift between the recorded
 *      version and the installed one is therefore invisible here — §4.8's
 *      own cannot-measure obligation, not this suite's, is what covers it.
 *   4. That the table of contents is FRESH. Arm 2 pins that a §4.8 row is
 *      PRESENT and nothing more. TOC freshness is the `toc-freshness` gate's
 *      predicate (`.github/workflows/check-toc.yml`, §3.3), and §3.11 binds
 *      ownership to the predicate: re-deriving it here would be a second
 *      implementation of a property another owner holds. Out of scope by
 *      OWNERSHIP, not by oversight — a stale line number in a present row
 *      passes here and is caught there.
 *
 * Disclosed fooling shapes of the matchers themselves:
 *
 *   5. Arms 3–6 bind at PARAGRAPH granularity, not sentence: splitting prose
 *      that carries `§4.8`, `.pi/` and `e.g.` into sentences is unreliable
 *      lexically, so the residual is that a pointer may sit in a neighbouring
 *      sentence of the right paragraph and still pass.
 *   6. The pointer matcher binds the exact token `§4.8`. A cross-reference
 *      spelled "section 4.8", or one that names the command layer in prose
 *      without the section token, is invisible.
 *   7. Arm 7 requires a three-part version adjacent to the substrate name
 *      (`pi 0.84.3`). A measurement recorded as a bare version, a two-part
 *      version, or against an unnamed substrate is invisible.
 *   8. The readers are line- and paragraph-lexical, not a Markdown parser: a
 *      `### 4.8 ` line inside a fenced code block would be read as a heading,
 *      and a table row inside the TOC markers is trusted to be a TOC row.
 *
 * The matchers' own teeth are pinned by the synthetic-mutant arms at the
 * bottom (§3.12): a green real-tree arm proves nothing unless the matcher
 * demonstrably reds on a tree that lacks the subject, so every matcher is
 * exercised in BOTH directions in-suite against synthetic strings.
 *
 * This suite reads one file and writes nothing: no network, no `gh`, no
 * `pi`, no fixture.
