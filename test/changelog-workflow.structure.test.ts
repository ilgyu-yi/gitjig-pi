/**
 * Structural suite for the changelog fragment-gate's WORKFLOW half (issue #45).
 *
 * Subject under test: the text of `.github/workflows/check-changelog.yml`.
 *
 * The gate's predicate lives in two files. `.github/workflows/check-changelog.sh`
 * is driven end to end by `changelog-gate.unit.test.ts` through its
 * stdin-and-`--root` seam. The half that lives in this workflow — the trigger
 * set, the concurrency group, and the draft-sleep branch in the validate
 * step's `run:` block — has no seam at all: nothing in this tree can execute a
 * `run:` block, and building that seam is its own change (issue #49). Until it
 * exists, the workflow's contract is pinned as TEXT. SPEC §2.5 permits exactly
 * this and no more: "A contract testable only by grepping prose is stranded —
 * it moves into code both sides call. Structural checks over prose files
 * remain normal tests."
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH (§3.11's report-only shape: a check that
 * does not establish a property says so, so a green run is never read as the
 * missing guarantee). Every assertion below is a claim about bytes on disk.
 * None of them is a claim about GitHub Actions' behaviour. Specifically, a
 * green run here does NOT establish:
 *
 *   1. That the workflow file is syntactically valid YAML, or that Actions
 *      accepts it. No YAML parser is reachable from here: the root manifest
 *      declares development and CI tools only, and this suite runs with no
 *      dependency on an installed tree — measured, 811/811 with
 *      `node_modules` absent — so the readers below are narrow text scanners
 *      over a comment-stripped view, not a parse. They can be fooled by YAML
 *      this repository does not write — quoted keys, anchors, flow mappings,
 *      an inline `#` inside a quoted scalar. The cost is accepted in exchange
 *      for asserting nothing about indentation beyond block boundaries.
 *   2. That a workflow whose own trigger set has changed self-applies on the
 *      pull request carrying that change. Nothing in this tree can observe
 *      that; it is a platform property, and the only way to settle it is to
 *      push the change and read which activity type the resulting runs carry.
 *   3. What the branch-protection required-check rollup honours when several
 *      runs of one check name exist at a single head. The concurrency group
 *      asserted below is the mechanism intended to keep that set to one; that
 *      it succeeds is a platform property, unmeasured here.
 *   4. That the shell inside any `run:` block executes as intended. The
 *      draft-sleep assertions match a comparison SHAPE in shell text. They
 *      cannot evaluate it, and they do not trace dataflow beyond the one
 *      assignment each names.
 *
 * The one-tree limit also bounds what can be asserted at all. "The
 * `skip-changelog` short-circuit step is unchanged" and "`check-changelog.sh`
 * is unchanged" are claims about a DIFF; a unit test sees one tree, not two,
 * and a pinned hash of another file reds for edits that have nothing to do
 * with this contract. Neither is asserted as such. What is asserted instead is
 * the state invariant whose loss would actually matter — that the label bypass
 * is still wired ahead of the gate (W5) — and the script's untouched-ness is
 * carried by `changelog-gate.unit.test.ts` staying green and by review, not
 * by this file.
 *
 * This suite reads one file from disk and writes nothing: no network, no `gh`,
 * no `pi`, no fixture.
