/**
 * Structural suite for the delegation-layer section (issue #81, Directive
 * #80; SPEC §4.9 "The delegation layer" and the sites amended to point at it
 * — the subset this suite binds is the one arms 4–7 and the intro arm name).
 *
 * Subject under test: the TEXT of `SPEC.md`. The change under test appends
 * `### 4.9 The delegation layer` after §4.8 and amends the sites that lean
 * on a dispatch object no section defines. The arms:
 *
 *   1. the reader arm — the extractors resolve landmarks that exist on the
 *      PRE-change tree (§4.8's TOC row; the three leaning-site phrases
 *      verbatim; §4's intro), so a red below means the subject is absent,
 *      never that the suite mis-reads the document;
 *   2. a `### 4.9 ` heading exists;
 *   3. §4.9 has exactly one row in the generated table of contents;
 *   4. §1.5's leaning paragraph — "the delegate roles are instruments that
 *      derive later" — carries a §4.9 pointer;
 *   5. §1.7's leaning paragraph — "the predicate and dispatch instruments
 *      derive later" — carries a §4.9 pointer;
 *   6. §1.8's leaning paragraph — the one assigning challenger axes
 *      "upstream by the dispatcher" — carries a §4.9 pointer;
 *   7. §4.8's span carries the reciprocal §4.9 pointer (issue #81 signal-2
 *      criterion: the boundary is drawn from both sides);
 *   8. the §4.9 span records a substrate-name-adjacent three-part version
 *      (issue #81 signal-1 criterion: the recorded measurement is that
 *      criterion's checkable residue, §2.4) AND carries the
 *      content-free-return sentence, pinned by a token pair;
 *   9. §4's intro paragraph enumerates §4.9 alongside its siblings.
 *
 * Arm 9 is a disclosed call: the caller's brief left the §4-intro
 * enumeration to this suite's judgment if it would duplicate arm 3. It does
 * not — arm 3 reads the generated TOC block between its markers and arm 9
 * reads §4's prose intro, disjoint text regions under disjoint matchers, the
 * same split the command-layer suite holds — so it stands as its own arm.
 *
 * A structural check over a prose file is the sanctioned shape here, not a
 * workaround: §2.5 — "Structural checks over prose files remain normal
 * tests." The arms are lexical scans over `SPEC.md`'s bytes; they run no
 * `pi`, build no fixture, and reach no network.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH (§3.11: "A report-only check names the
 * property it does not establish, so a green report is never read as the
 * missing guarantee"). Every claim below is LEXICAL — about prose text —
 * and none is a claim about a live delegation layer. Specifically, a green
 * run does NOT establish:
 *
 *   1. That a dispatcher EXISTS. Lexical, not live: nothing here reads
 *      `.pi/`, dispatches a delegate, or provisions an isolated context, and
 *      issue #81's boundary puts authoring a dispatch instrument out of
 *      scope; §4.9 can be fully green with the layer entirely unbuilt.
 *   2. That the homing rule §4.9 states is CORRECT — that the substrate
 *      surface it selects really exists, really carries the isolation §1.5
 *      requires, or is usable at all. Those are judgments at review (§2.3),
 *      not properties of a matcher over text.
 *   3. That the recorded measurement is CURRENT. Arm 8 asserts the PRESENCE
 *      and SHAPE of a substrate-version token, never equality against the
 *      installed `pi --version`: a clone carrying a newer substrate would
 *      red on an equality arm with no defect present, and §3.12 rules that
 *      "a check that can false-red is a defect". Drift between the recorded
 *      version and the installed one is invisible here — §4.9's own
 *      drifted-substrate-reads-as-cannot-measure obligation, not this
 *      suite's, is what covers it.
 *   4. That the table of contents is FRESH. Arm 3 pins that a §4.9 row is
 *      PRESENT and nothing more. TOC freshness is the `toc-freshness` gate's
 *      predicate (`.github/workflows/check-toc.yml`, §3.3), and §3.11 binds
 *      ownership to the predicate: re-deriving it here would be a second
 *      implementation of a property another owner holds. Out of scope by
 *      OWNERSHIP, not by oversight.
 *   5. That any instrument HONORS the content-free-return sentence. Arm 8's
 *      token check pins that the sentence EXISTS in §4.9's prose — that the
 *      section states the bounded return stays content-free and never
 *      supplies the compare operand — never that a delegate's return is in
 *      fact content-free or that §1.6's blind compare is performed.
 *
 * Disclosed fooling shapes of the matchers themselves:
 *
 *   6. Arms 4–7 and 9 bind at PARAGRAPH (or span) granularity, not
 *      sentence: a pointer may sit in a neighbouring sentence of the right
 *      paragraph and still pass.
 *   7. The pointer matcher binds the exact token `§4.9`. A cross-reference
 *      spelled "section 4.9", or one that names the delegation layer in
 *      prose without the section token, is invisible.
 *   8. Arm 8's version matcher requires a three-part version adjacent to
 *      the substrate name (`pi 0.84.3`). A measurement recorded as a bare
 *      version, a two-part version, or against an unnamed substrate is
 *      invisible. Its sentence matcher is inflection-tolerant by design
 *      (`content-free`/`content free`, `compare`/`comparison operand(s)`)
 *      and killed by absence, so a paragraph inside §4.9 that carries both
 *      tokens while saying something else would pass, and a synonym pair
 *      the pattern does not spell (e.g. "opaque return") is invisible.
 *   9. The readers are line- and paragraph-lexical, not a Markdown parser:
 *      a `### 4.9 ` line inside a fenced code block would be read as a
 *      heading, and a table row inside the TOC markers is trusted to be a
 *      TOC row.
 *
 * The matchers' own teeth are pinned by the synthetic-mutant arms at the
 * bottom (§3.12): a green real-tree arm proves nothing unless the matcher
 * demonstrably reds on a tree that lacks the subject, so every matcher is
 * exercised in BOTH directions in-suite against synthetic strings.
 *
 * This suite reads one file and writes nothing: no network, no `gh`, no
 * `pi`, no fixture.
