/**
 * Behavioral suite for the staged-secret class and the protected-branch
 * commit arm at the pre-commit adapter (issue #66 ACs; SPEC §3.3
 * staged-scan semantics + ref-identity semantics, §3.8, §3.9, §3.10).
 *
 * Subject under test: the COMMITTED local-tier chain — this repository's
 * `.githooks/pre-commit` + `.githooks/_lib.sh`, copied byte-for-byte into a
 * disposable git repository by `harness/githook-fixture.ts` and driven only
 * through `git commit` (the arms measure the chain an operator runs, never
 * a predicate called directly).
 *
 * ARMED-CHAIN ASSERTIONS. Every refuse- and record-shaped arm asserts the
 * armed contract: while `.githooks/helpers/secret_scan.sh` is absent from
 * the tree, `pre-commit`'s require chain falls through `githook_source`'s
 * fail-open branch to `exit 0` and every guarded commit SUCCEEDS with no
 * block record — those arms are red by design until the helper lands (§1.2
 * failing-first). Allow-shaped and no-op arms are boundary pins, green in
 * BOTH tree states; each declares itself one.
 *
 * Environment constraints stated in place:
 *   - Every planted secret and every hostile byte is BUILT AT RUNTIME from
 *     codepoint constants and concatenation, never written literally: a
 *     literal secret-shaped string in this source would trip the
 *     development shell's own staged-secret matcher the moment this file
 *     is committed (the measured hazard), and later this repository's own
 *     armed hook. The construction also keeps the byte-absence assertions
 *     honest — the asserted sequence exists only at runtime.
 *   - Pattern-file substrate, stated per arm and summarized here: the
 *     committed pattern file (`.githooks/helpers/secret-patterns`) ships
 *     with its scanner, so scan-shaped arms that need patterns author the
 *     PLANNED rows into the FIXTURE's copy only while the committed file
 *     is absent (`ensurePlannedPatterns`); once the file ships, those arms
 *     measure the committed bytes, so a dropped committed row reddens its
 *     own refusal arm (§3.12). Machinery arms author their own degenerate
 *     fixture-local pattern files unconditionally — their contract IS the
 *     degenerate file. The committed-file pins at the bottom assert
 *     against the repository path itself and are red until the file lands.
 *   - The protected identity and every content marker use DISTINCTIVE
 *     spellings (`zq…`): byte-level "these bytes reached no surface"
 *     assertions must not collide with incidental git output.
 *   - Where two refusal causes must stay distinguishable, the staged
 *     filenames differ only in a decimal digit and comparisons use
 *     decimal-normalized cause shapes, so path spelling cannot green the
 *     distinctness vacuously.
 *   - POSIX bytes and bash are required throughout: the suite skips on
 *     win32. The unreadable-allow-list arm additionally skips for root,
 *     for whom mode 000 denies nothing.
