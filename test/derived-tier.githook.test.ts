/**
 * Behavioral suite for the local tier that DERIVES its own locations
 * (issue #68 amended ACs; SPEC §3.2 derivation + arm-ordered fold + push
 * stdin discipline, §4.1 helper home is also how helpers are found, §4.2
 * no generated code beside the committed bytes, §4.6 one derivation both
 * sides perform, §5.2 fold-to-allow signals, §5.5 record writer).
 *
 * Subject under test: the fixture's byte-verified copy of THIS repository's
 * `.githooks/` tree, activated the only way a clone activates it —
 * `core.hooksPath` — and measured through `git commit` / `git push`, never
 * a predicate called directly. Nothing is written at `.gitjig/` by the
 * fixture: the tier resolves its helper directory from the running file's
 * own installed position and its record sink from the repository top, so a
 * clone that has activated the hooks path is fully armed.
 *
 * FIXTURE DISCIPLINE (three traps, each measured on this change):
 *   - the WHOLE `.githooks` tree is copied by `buildGithookFixture`, which
 *     byte-verifies the copy: copying `helpers/*.sh` alone drops the
 *     extensionless `helpers/secret-patterns`, the scan silently disarms,
 *     and every "allow" measured against it means nothing;
 *   - every arm that asserts an ALLOW opens with `assertFixtureArmed` on
 *     the same fixture, which proves that fixture refuses a staged
 *     pattern-matching key before the arm's mutation lands;
 *   - the fixture mints its own state. No arm reads this clone's own
 *     `.gitjig/` — that is a foreign file, not one the tier authored.
 *
 * Environment constraints (sibling-suite doctrine, stated in place):
 *   - every secret fragment is BUILT FROM CODEPOINTS, never literal, so
 *     this source cannot trip the shell's own staged-secret matcher and
 *     byte-absence assertions stay honest;
 *   - distinctive `zq…` markers wherever a byte-presence or byte-absence
 *     assertion runs, so incidental git output cannot collide;
 *   - every spawn is timeout-wrapped; POSIX substrate only (skips win32).
 *
 * PINNED SPELLINGS (the wording contract this suite and the tier share):
 *   - a fail-open fold says `not enforced` plainly (SPEC §3.9's
 *     degradation-signal rule; §4.5's inventory sentence);
 *   - a refusal names the matched pattern's ID (`aws-access-key-id`) and
 *     never the matched bytes (§3.3, §3.8).
