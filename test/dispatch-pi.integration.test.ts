/**
 * Hermetic pi integration suite for the dispatch instrument's registered
 * tool (issue #88; SPEC §4.9 — one home, many call sites; the measured
 * ground: a registered tool's result enters the run's session file).
 *
 * Drives one real `pi` session through `harness/run-pi.ts` whose scripted
 * provider issues a `gitjig_dispatch` toolCall. Every instrument arm is
 * RED until the Code phase registers the tool: the toolCall reaches no
 * handler today, the substrate answers "Tool gitjig_dispatch not found",
 * and each arm's first assertion is authored to fail on exactly that
 * absence (the sibling egress suites' anchor, verbatim in shape).
 *
 * FIXTURE SHAPE (the harness is read-only; the repo mints inline). The
 * gitjig runtime enters the fixture as COPIED bytes, not the sibling
 * suites' symlinks: the runtime resolves its repository root from its own
 * REALPATH (`locate.ts`, §4.6), so a symlinked install resolves to this
 * repository — and this suite needs the dispatcher's caller repo to be the
 * fixture itself. The copies are read from this repository's tree at
 * build time, so the committed bytes are still what runs. The fixture
 * root is then `git init`ed and a PATH-SCOPED add commits exactly the
 * delegate-visible assets — `.pi/` (scripted provider + gitjig runtime),
 * the delegate script, the child's script file, one content file — and
 * deliberately NOT the parent's `script.json`: the clone must not carry
 * the parent's turns, or the child session would replay the dispatch
 * toolCall recursively. Commits ride
 * `-c user.name=zq -c user.email=zq@zq.zq -c commit.gpgsign=false`
 * (mandatory: the host signs commits and the throwaway identity cannot).
 *
 * THE ROUND TRIP (modeled on the Doc commit's measured delegate shape:
 * a no-hardlinks clone carrying committed `.pi/` runs a headless child
 * session on the scripted provider). The dispatched delegate is
 * `sh zq-delegate.sh` in the cloned tree: it stages the CHILD's script,
 * runs a child `pi -p` session there (the clone's committed provider and
 * runtime load; the child's state seam is the executor-provided
 * `<scratch>/state`), keys on the child's `DELEGATE_DONE marker-alpha`
 * output, computes `git rev-parse HEAD` in the clone, and writes the
 * bounded return to `../return.json` — fixed printf formats, so the
 * return is well-formed JSON whatever the child printed.
 *
 * AUTHORED PHASE-C CONTRACT (beyond the module suite's): the tool is
 * named `gitjig_dispatch`; its arguments are `{ brief: string,
 * delegateArgv: string[], expectedRef?: string }` (`expectedRef` a ref
 * NAME, resolved once in the caller repository); the result carries the
 * admitted return's summary and, when a `reviewedHead` was consumed, the
 * compare verdict token (`confirmed`/`invalid`) — validity alone, never
 * an operand; the dispatch act lands at least one `"category":"dispatch"`
 * audit record through the landed writer; the executor passes the parent
 * environment through (the child `pi` needs the parent's PATH/HOME/
 * PI_OFFLINE isolation) with the repo-locating and config-injection
 * `GIT_*` families removed and the state seam rebound into the scratch.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH. The round trip proves the
 * DISPATCHER's provision → child-session → bounded-return path, never any
 * delegate's quality: the child is a scripted echo, and a green run says
 * nothing about what a real delegate would do with the brief. The
 * operand-absence sweep is LEXICAL — case-folded hex runs held against the
 * held operand on the implementation's own rule: containment from six
 * characters, the held 7-prefix at any length (issue #104) — on the
 * surfaces read here: the tool's result entries, the audit
 * trail, and the session transcript with the assistant
 * toolCall-arguments field excluded BY NAME (the sibling suites'
 * measured residual: the assistant message persists the call's own
 * arguments; nothing this suite sends carries the hash there, and the
 * exclusion keeps the sweep honest about that surface rather than
 * crediting it) — a paraphrased or re-encoded operand is §4.9's
 * injectable-context residual, not this sweep's catch. The scratch (child sessions included) is cleaned on
 * success, so no arm reads it. One run, one direction per surface: the
 * compare-invalid and refusal directions are the module suite's arms.
 *
 * The sweep helpers' own teeth are pinned in-suite against synthetic
 * strings, both directions (§3.12) — those arms are green on this tree;
 * every instrument arm is red.
