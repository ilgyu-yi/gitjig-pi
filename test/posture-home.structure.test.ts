/**
 * Structural suite for the fail-posture inventory home (issue #55 AC3;
 * SPEC §3.9 "One inventory, one home", §6.1's inventory rule).
 *
 * Subject under test: the text of every shipped enforcement source — the
 * tier-1 runtime under `.pi/extensions/`, the local tier under
 * `.githooks/` (including any file under `.githooks/helpers/`), and the
 * tier-3 instruments under `.github/workflows/` — with the one stated home,
 * `.pi/extensions/gitjig/postures.ts`, excluded. The roster is WALKED from
 * those three roots rather than enumerated per file, so a source added
 * tomorrow (a new helper, a new workflow) is scanned the day it lands and
 * cannot drift in unguarded (§3.10's structural-lock shape).
 *
 * The recognizer is lexical, over a comment-stripped view (TS block/line
 * comments for `.ts`; whole-line `#` comments for everything else — hooks,
 * helpers, workflow YAML and shell). It reports two shapes:
 *
 *   1. a posture ASSIGNMENT — `posture`, an optional closing quote, `:` or
 *      `=`, then an optionally quoted `open`/`closed` value — the shape a
 *      posture row takes in TS, JSON, YAML, or a shell assignment;
 *   2. any use of `PostureRow` — a second table built on the home's own row
 *      type is the loudest possible second home.
 *
 * Prose is what the comment-stripping exists for: every "posture" the
 * shipped sources write outside the home today sits in comments, and a
 * sentence like "the posture of this gate is closed" never matches shape 1
 * (no `:`/`=` between the word and the value).
 *
 * WHAT THIS SUITE DOES NOT ESTABLISH (§3.11's report-only rule: a check
 * names the property it does not establish). Disclosed fooling shapes:
 *
 *   1. A posture declared under a DIFFERENT key (`failMode: "closed"`,
 *      `onMiss = open`) is invisible — the recognizer binds to the word
 *      the SPEC and the home use, not to the concept.
 *   2. A posture VALUE built dynamically (`posture: pick(mode)`, a ternary)
 *      is invisible: shape 1 requires a literal `open`/`closed` at the
 *      declaration site.
 *   3. A `posture: "open"` inside a string literal (a message quoting the
 *      shape) is a false positive — this suite fails toward reporting, and
 *      the remedy is rewording the message, not allowlisting (the
 *      exemption set is deliberately empty).
 *   4. The comment-strippers are lexical, not parsers: a `#` or `//` inside
 *      a string that begins a line, or a declaration sharing a line with a
 *      trailing comment, can be mis-stripped — the same residual the
 *      warning-surface suite's strippers disclose.
 *   5. Enforcement sources outside the three walked roots (none exist
 *      today) are not scanned; a fourth root joins ROOTS by being named.
 *   6. COMPLETENESS IS NOT THIS SUITE'S PROPERTY. This suite establishes
 *      that no SECOND home exists; it says nothing about whether the one
 *      home carries a row for every cause the shipped code declares. A
 *      tree can pass every arm here while the inventory omits shapes the
 *      helpers disarm on — which is what issue #112 measured. That
 *      direction is `posture-completeness.structure.test.ts`; a green run
 *      here must not be read as a complete inventory.
 *
 * The recognizer's own teeth are pinned by the synthetic-mutant arms at
 * the bottom (§3.12): a green real-tree arm proves nothing unless an
 * out-of-home mutant demonstrably reds, so both directions are exercised
 * in-suite against synthetic sources.
 *
 * This suite reads files and writes nothing: no network, no `gh`, no `pi`,
 * no fixture.
