# Changelog fragment authoring

Every PR that lands an end-user-observable change adds a **changelog fragment** to this directory. The next `/release X.Y.Z` consolidates all present fragments into a new section in `CHANGELOG.md` at repo root, grouped by category, and deletes the consumed fragments in the same commit.

## Where it goes

`changelog_unreleased/<category>/<N>.md` where:

- `<category>` is one of six [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) categories. Pick by the kind of change:
  - `added/` — new features, new commands, new public surfaces.
  - `changed/` — behavior or appearance of existing features changes for the user.
  - `deprecated/` — feature still works but is on its way out; users should migrate.
  - `removed/` — feature no longer present.
  - `fixed/` — bug fix the user would notice.
  - `security/` — fix for a vulnerability or a security-posture improvement.
- `<N>` is the PR number that introduces the fragment (or the issue number when filing the fragment ahead of the PR). Positive integer; **filename stem must equal the `<N>` referenced inside the bullet**.

## What it contains

A **single-line markdown bullet** beginning with `- `. The bullet **must contain `(#<N>)`** where `<N>` matches the filename stem. The CI fragment-check validates **every** added fragment (one valid fragment does not excuse a malformed sibling in the same PR) and rejects:

- Files outside the six category subdirectories.
- Filenames whose stem is not a positive integer.
- Bullets whose `(#<N>)` reference does not match the filename stem.
- Bullets that do not begin with `- `.

That is the entire contract. No YAML frontmatter. No multi-paragraph prose. No nested headers. The directory is the category, the filename is the issue/PR link, the bullet is the user-facing line.

## Example

`changelog_unreleased/added/142.md`:

```markdown
- New `/release` skill consolidates per-PR fragments into a versioned `CHANGELOG.md` section and creates the matching tag + Release on merge. (#142)
```

## Skipping

A PR with no user- or adopter-observable change — an internal refactor with unchanged behavior, test-only, a `chore`/`build`/`ci` change, `style`, or a docs-internal edit that changes no contract — applies the `skip-changelog` label to the PR instead of adding a fragment. When in doubt, write the fragment: a redundant one-line entry is cheaper than a silently missing one. PRs that take the skip path produce no fragment and do not appear in the eventual `CHANGELOG.md` section.

Apply the criterion above directly: observable user or adopter behavior gets a fragment; an internal-only change may use the `skip-changelog` label.
