# resolve_parent_directive.sh — label-aware reflection-target resolver.
#
# Sourced by .github/workflows/dir-mode-post-merge.yml (after actions/checkout)
# to decide which Directive a merged PR's reflection comment lands on. Extracted
# from inline workflow run-block bash so the logic is shellcheckable
# and testable rather than untestable.
#
# resolve_parent_directive <pr_num> <repo>
#   For each closing Issue of the merged PR, climb the `Parent Directive: #N`
#   body-marker chain to the FIRST `directive`-labelled ancestor.
#   The marker target may be an *umbrella* Execution Issue rather than the
#   Directive itself; a first-marker pick would mis-target the umbrella,
#   so each hop checks the target's labels and climbs one more level if it is
#   not `directive`-labelled. Depth-cap 2 hops, visited-set cycle guard.
#
#   On success prints two lines to stdout, suitable for appending to
#   $GITHUB_OUTPUT:
#       directive=<D>
#       exec_issue=<E>
#   On no resolution prints a visible no-op note to stderr and nothing to stdout
#   (the inline predecessor was silent). ALWAYS returns 0 — a gh failure resolves
#   to "no Directive" (fail-soft) rather than aborting the merge workflow. Every
#   gh call carries --repo so it works on a runner with no git context.
# climb_to_directive <start_issue> <repo>
#   From <start_issue>, follow the `^Parent Directive: #N` body-marker chain up
#   to the FIRST `directive`-labelled ancestor. Prints that Directive's number on
#   success, nothing otherwise. Depth-cap 2 hops, visited-set cycle guard,
#   fail-soft (any gh failure → empty, return 0). Shared by resolve_parent_directive
#   (reflection target) and detect_bare_refs_directive (bare-Refs gate); a
#   single climb implementation avoids the two drifting apart.
