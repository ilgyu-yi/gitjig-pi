# check-changelog.sh — the changelog fragment-gate predicate (issue #43).
#
# The body the `fragment-gate` job calls. It is driven entirely through two
# seams, so it is runnable without network, `gh`, or a repository checkout:
#
#   printf '%s' "$FILES_JSON" | bash check-changelog.sh \
#     --pr <n> --expected-count <n> --allowed "<stems>" --root <dir>
#
#   stdin            the JSON `gh api --paginate --slurp
#                    .../pulls/N/files?per_page=100` produces: an array of
#                    pages, each page an array of file objects (flatten
#                    `.[][]`). Objects carry `filename`, `status`, and for
#                    renames `previous_filename`.
#   --pr             the pull request number, for message text.
#   --expected-count the PR's `changedFiles`, an independent count of the
#                    listing's expected length.
#   --allowed        whitespace-separated fragment stems in one argument:
#                    the PR number union its closing-issue numbers.
#   --root           the directory fragment paths resolve against when their
#                    content is read. Annotations keep the repo-relative path
#                    so they still resolve on the platform.
#
# Exit 0 = pass, exit 1 = block. No third code is in the contract.
#
# The predicate is SPEC §1.3's floor over the NET file listing, in two
# independent clauses, preceded by three fail-closed arms:
#
#   Fail-closed  An empty payload (the gate was handed no listing to read), a
#                flattened length disagreeing with --expected-count
#                (truncation), and a `status` outside the known set. Each
#                carries its own message, so an unread payload is never
#                reported as a truncated one; and all three stay
#                distinguishable from clause 1, so a transport-shaped failure
#                is never reported as "the author forgot a fragment".
#   Clause 1     Existential, permissive. At least one non-`removed` entry of
#                fragment shape, in the allow-set, with valid content. A
#                fragment that fails it is merely not a witness.
#   Clause 2     Universal, no-junk. Every `added`/`renamed`/`copied` entry of
#                fragment shape is valid; one valid fragment never excuses a
#                malformed sibling. A re-categorising move — an `added` stem
#                that also appears among the listing's `removed` fragment
#                stems, or a `renamed` entry from one fragment path to another
#                leaving the stem unchanged — is exempt from the allow-set
#                rule ALONE, because that stem was in the allow-set of the PR
#                that first added the fragment. Presence, bullet form, the
#                same-line (#N) ref and the positive-stem rule all still run
#                on it, so a move cannot carry a content rewrite past the
#                clause, and a rename from outside changelog_unreleased/ is
#                an addition rather than a re-categorisation.
#
# Residual — what this gate deliberately leaves unreached (§3.11), so each
# gap reads as a decision rather than an oversight:
#
#   1. A `modified` fragment's content is not validated for form. §1.3's
#      second clause binds added fragments; a weaker second predicate over a
#      class the floor does not bind would be a divergence surface.
#      Review-enforced.
#   2. A `removed` fragment is not gated. Emptying the tree is the release
#      backbone's own act.
#   3. Exactly-one is not enforced. §1.3 keeps that above the CI floor;
#      review-enforced.
#   4. Category correctness and bullet truthfulness are not judged — no
#      machine reading distinguishes `fixed` from `changed`, or a true bullet
#      from a plausible one.
#   5. `copied` is classified but unexercised by the suite; the platform is
#      unlikely to emit it for this tree.
#   6. A pull request at the platform's file-listing ceiling. `changedFiles`
#      is a GraphQL count while the Files API caps at 3000, so the two do not
#      share a ceiling and the truncation comparison does detect real
#      truncation.
#   7. The `skip-changelog` label step's own `gh pr view` is un-armed under
#      `set -euo pipefail`: a transport failure there fails the job with no
#      message. Pre-existing, and out of this change's scope.
#   8. Merge-ref versus head skew. `actions/checkout` on `pull_request`
#      checks out the merge commit while the listing is merge-base..head, so
#      a fragment landed concurrently on the base is present in the checkout
#      and correctly not validated.
