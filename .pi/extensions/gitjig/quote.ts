/**
 * Escaping for actor-influenced text on an operator surface (issue #47).
 *
 * Every warning and refusal these modules emit interpolates a path, and
 * POSIX admits a line break or an escape byte in any path component — so
 * an actor who names a directory can otherwise forge a line INTO the one
 * signal whose job is to say the gate is disarmed (§3.9: a reader must
 * never mistake a disarmed gate for a passing one), or erase that signal
 * from a terminal with the ANSI erase-line sequence. `quoted` is the
 * single spelling every such interpolation goes through, holding a
 * double contract:
 *
 *   - it ESCAPES: a line feed becomes the two characters backslash-n,
 *     the ESC byte becomes the six characters backslash-u001b — and the
 *     classes `JSON.stringify` leaves raw are closed by a post-pass:
 *     DEL and the C1 controls (U+007F–U+009F, holding NEL the line
 *     break and U+009B the one-byte CSI), the LINE/PARAGRAPH
 *     SEPARATORS (U+2028/U+2029), and the bidi controls (U+061C the
 *     ARABIC LETTER MARK, U+200E, U+200F, U+202A–U+202E,
 *     U+2066–U+2069) all render as backslash-u escapes. So no
 *     component can start a line of its own, land a control byte on
 *     the operator's terminal, or reorder how the signal displays —
 *     the standard the record write already meets at the sink (§5.5:
 *     any free text encoded at write time);
 *   - it DELIMITS: the quotes mark the value's exact extent, for the
 *     operator pasting a recovery act into a shell and for the suite's
 *     clause reader alike — whitespace inside the value no longer reads
 *     as the value's end. Under the default JSON delimiter that is
 *     extent-marking only, not shell-neutralization: dollar, backtick
 *     and backslash stay live inside POSIX double quotes when the value
 *     is pasted as-is. A clause composed as a command to paste therefore
 *     asks for the `"shell"` delimiter — POSIX single quotes, embedded
 *     single quotes folded through the quote-backslash-quote-quote
 *     idiom — inside which the shell substitutes and expands nothing,
 *     so a substitution-shaped component arrives at the pasted command
 *     as bytes, not as an execution (issue #53). Both delimiters run
 *     the same escape classes; only the extent-marking differs.
 *
 * Warning-surface roster: EXEMPT — this module IS the escaper, so it is
 * the one file the lock cannot range over without regress. Its two
 * interpolations are the escaping itself: `escapeRaw` composes the
 * `\uXXXX` form from the codepoint it is escaping, and the shell
 * delimiter folds an embedded single quote through the
 * quote-backslash-quote-quote idiom. Rendering either through `quoted()`
 * would call this function on its own output and escape the escapes. The
 * exemption is structural and bounded to that circularity: it is not a
 * statement that text here is safe by inspection, and every OTHER module
 * that interpolates is on the roster. What this module owes instead is the
 * behavioural pinning of its own contract, which lives in
 * `test/primitives.unit.test.ts` rather than in the lexical lock.
 *
 * One named helper rather than `JSON.stringify` at each site because the
 * structural lock (`test/warning-surface.structure.test.ts`) needs one
 * greppable admit-rule, and because the contract above needs one place to
 * live (§3.10 — uniform mitigation, empty exemption set, structural
 * lock). The hostile bytes are still DISPLAYED, as escaped text: the
 * contract is one line and no control bytes, not concealment. The
 * non-bidi invisible format characters — ZERO WIDTH SPACE (U+200B) and
 * its class — pass through raw: a concealment-only residual this
 * contract discloses and declines to close (§3.11).
 *
 * A second residual, on the SHELL delimiter alone (§3.11, issue #65).
 * Shell mode never escapes backslash — POSIX single quotes make every byte
 * inside them literal, backslash included, so escaping it would put a
 * second backslash into the pasted path. The consequence is a spelling
 * AMBIGUITY, not an injection: a component literally named with a
 * backslash-u spelling renders identically to this module's own escape of
 * the real codepoint, so a reader cannot tell the two apart from the
 * rendering. JSON mode keeps them distinguishable, because it escapes the
 * backslash. No control byte lands either way and the paste stays
 * substitution-dead either way, so what is lost is a reader's ability to
 * say which of two paths was named — disclosed here rather than closed,
 * because closing it would corrupt the operand the clause exists to hand
 * to an act.
