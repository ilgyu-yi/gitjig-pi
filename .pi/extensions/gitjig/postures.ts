Outside those terms the outcome is not this tier's to decide and the fold's line and record may not run — measured on a sourced helper, `trap ':' EXIT; exit 5` refuses the commit and `trap 'exit 0' EXIT; exit 5` creates it, both with no tier bytes on either stream and no record — so in the allow direction this tier's surfaces carry exactly what an enforced pass carries.",
