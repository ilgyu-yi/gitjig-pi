/**
 * The /review command — an operator-initiated call site of the ONE
 * dispatcher (SPEC §4.9 "one home, many call sites"; §4.8 rung 1: the
 * blind compare and the caller-derived round count are acts that must not
 * be contingent on a model's cooperation).
 *
 * Argument string: `[timeoutMs=<n>] <expectedRef> <delegateArgv…>`,
 * whitespace-split, the bound optional and recognized in first position only
 * (issue #94 — a positional grammar cannot tell a bound token from a delegate
 * argv element anywhere else). The
 * handler resolves no ref itself: `expectedRef` crosses to the dispatcher,
 * which resolves it exactly once at provision and holds the hash (§4.9
 * pin-at-provision). What this command returns to the session is its own
 * entry — the disposition, the compare's VALIDITY token
 * (`confirmed`/`invalid`), and the admitted summary — never an operand
 * (§1.6 via §4.9's content-free return channels). The dispatch acts land
 * their `category:"dispatch"` audit records inside the dispatcher itself;
 * this module mints no record and no second channel.
 *
 * No reviewer instructions, no verdict grammar, and no role prompt ride
 * this surface: the delegate's conduct is carried by its own argv and the
 * provisioned tree — the instruct half of the worked case is §4.8's
 * enumerated residual, never this registration's carry.
 *
 * The handler confines itself to channels the print path wires (§4.4):
 * `pi.appendEntry`, `pi.sendMessage`, and `ctx.waitForIdle` — the last is
 * bound by print mode itself. After the entry is appended the handler
 * triggers ONE empty custom-message turn and awaits idle, because the
 * substrate writes a NEW session's entries to disk only once an assistant
 * message exists (`SessionManager._persist` buffers until then): without
 * the turn, a command-only headless run would leave no durable record of
 * the dispatch at all.
