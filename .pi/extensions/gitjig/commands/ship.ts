/**
 * The /ship command — the merge boundary's caller-side composition (SPEC
 * §4.8 rung 1, worked case `ship`; a call site of the predicates the §3.3
 * `merge-review` and `ac-closeout` rows own, both `procedural today` —
 * evaluated over facts the caller supplies, deciding nothing the platform
 * holds and adding no enforcement).
 *
 * No merge is performed and no network is reached. Three offline
 * undecidables are named in the registered description, which is the
 * command's registration record: the platform-held review verdict, the
 * platform-held AC state, and the merge act itself.
 *
 * Fact grammar — whitespace-split `key=value` tokens on the argument
 * string:
 *
 *   `verdict-head=<hash>` — the head the caller read the approving review
 *     verdict pinned at, off the platform surface;
 *   `ac=closed` — the caller's assertion that AC closure is discharged on
 *     the platform surface.
 *
 * The local head is resolved EXACTLY once per invocation, by one git child
 * under the scrubbed env (`withoutRepoLocatingGitEnv` — an inherited
 * GIT_DIR would retarget the read at another repository, §1.5), and
 * `composition` is `satisfied` iff the supplied verdict head byte-equals
 * that once-resolved head AND the AC-closure fact is asserted; any absent,
 * unequal, or unresolvable input composes `unsatisfied`. The session entry
 * carries per-check tokens alone — never the resolved head and never the
 * supplied one: an expected head in an injectable context makes every
 * later blind compare at that head echoable (§1.6 via §4.9's content-free
 * channels).
 *
 * The handler confines itself to channels the print path wires (§4.4):
 * `pi.appendEntry`, `pi.sendMessage`, and `ctx.waitForIdle` — the last is
 * bound by print mode itself. After the entry is appended the handler
 * triggers ONE empty custom-message turn and awaits idle, because the
 * substrate writes a NEW session's entries to disk only once an assistant
 * message exists (`SessionManager._persist` buffers until then): without
 * the turn, a command-only headless run would leave no durable record of
 * the composition at all.
