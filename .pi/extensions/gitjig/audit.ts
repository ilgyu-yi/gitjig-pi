/**
 * Audit primitive — one record per line (SPEC §5.5).
 *
 * Each record is a single JSON object on its own line in
 * `<stateRoot>/audit.jsonl`. Free text passes through `JSON.stringify`
 * at write time, so embedded newlines and control characters can never
 * split a record.
 *
 * The sink is opened rather than appended to by name, on two counts §4.6
 * and §5.5 make binding:
 *
 *   - `O_NOFOLLOW` — the evidence comes to rest at the path the gate
 *     reads, and in the file that path names (§4.6). What a symlink
 *     planted at the sink path buys its planter is not a write/read
 *     divergence: a consumer reading the sink BY NAME follows the same
 *     link to the same bytes, so both sides do agree. What it buys is
 *     the record itself — every line lands in a file the planter chose
 *     and can read, and can rewrite before any consumer reads it. The
 *     open refuses the link instead of following it, and the refusal
 *     degrades open like any other unwritable destination.
 *   - mode `0600` — the record at rest is readable only by the account
 *     that writes it (§5.5). Passed on the create, which makes `0600` a
 *     CEILING rather than a mode independent of the ambient umask: a
 *     umask only removes bits, so the sink is never looser than `0600`
 *     and may be tighter (measured: `umask 077` and `umask 022` both
 *     land `600`; `umask 777` lands `000`, which the next append then
 *     degrades open on). The direction that matters for §5.5 is the one
 *     the ceiling binds. The sink is a file only this runtime writes, so
 *     no legitimate flow is refused (§3.6 obligation (i)).
 *
 * Fail posture (§3.9, `audit-append` row): a missing or unwritable
 * destination degrades OPEN — warn, return `false`, never throw. The
 * warning names the consequence in plain words, because §3.9 requires a
 * gate that fails open to say it is not enforced rather than leave a
 * reader to infer it; the returned boolean is what lets a caller record
 * that outcome on a durable surface. This primitive also never creates
 * the destination directory: state-root creation belongs to the first
 * operational writer, not to observability (§3.8 — additive
 * observability never moves a fail direction).
 *
 * `stateRoot` must be ABSOLUTE, and a root that is not is refused the
 * same way any other unusable destination is — warn, return `false`,
 * never throw. A relative or empty root is resolved against the process
 * working directory, which §4.6 keeps off the hot path, and would put
 * the trail wherever the process happens to stand rather than inside
 * the repository whose work it records (§5.5). `resolveStateRoot`
 * already refuses an empty or relative seam, so nothing shipped reaches
 * this arm; it is here because the mirror-image precondition on
 * `locateRepoRootFrom` was closed on exactly this reasoning, and a sink
 * that writes evidence to an ambient location is the harsher half of
 * the pair. It refuses by degrading rather than by throwing, as
 * `locateRepoRootFrom` does, because the `audit-append` row is open
 * where `repo-root-discovery` is not.
 *
 * Neither flag closes every hostile shape at the sink path, so the open
 * is followed by one `fstat` VERDICT on the descriptor it returned —
 * no TOCTOU window, the verdict binds to the opened inode (#44). It
 * refuses anything that is not a regular file carrying exactly one name,
 * no group/other mode bits, and this account's ownership; every refusal
 * degrades open like any other unwritable destination. The hard link is
 * why `nlink === 1` is demanded: the link IS a regular file this account
 * can append to, so `O_NOFOLLOW` admits it and every record would land
 * in an inode another name owns and can read. A FIFO is why `O_NONBLOCK`
 * rides `SINK_FLAGS`: `openSync` on a reader-less FIFO otherwise blocks
 * before any verdict can run, hanging the extension factory that appends
 * at load. With the flag, the reader-less open raises `ENXIO` at once
 * and an open with a reader returns a descriptor the verdict refuses —
 * both branches terminate, so §5.9's hung-dependency requirement is met
 * by this narrower fix and NO timeout wrapper sits at factory scope: a
 * timeout converts a refusal that carries its cause into one that
 * carries none. The flag is never cleared — Node exposes no `fcntl` to
 * clear it, and clearing is unnecessary because only a regular file
 * survives the verdict and POSIX gives `O_NONBLOCK` no effect on
 * regular-file `write(2)`. What stays open (§3.11): a symlinked ANCESTOR
 * of the sink path is still followed — the admissible-target policy for
 * ancestors belongs to the state-root seam (§5.5) and is not closed
 * here.
 *
 * The record is written through `writeRecordLine` — the fd form of
 * `writeFileSync`, never `writeSync`. `writeSync` is one `write(2)`: it
 * returns a byte COUNT, and a count smaller than the payload leaves the
 * caller holding a partial record it believes is the whole one, so the
 * append returns `true` and a durable registration entry folds a clean
 * `auditWritable`. What the fd form removes is that FALSE SUCCESS: it
 * loops until the buffer drains and raises the underlying error when it
 * cannot, so a record that did not land whole is reported as a failure.
 * That is the same false success the close handling below exists to
 * remove, on the write side.
 *
 * It does NOT make the append transactional: "the record was written"
 * and "the append degraded" are not exclusive at the file level, and the
 * reported failure is about the caller's belief, not about the bytes at
 * the destination. A failure part-way through the loop
 * leaves an unterminated prefix at the sink AND takes the degradation
 * path; the next append concatenates onto that prefix, so the sink
 * carries one malformed line. That torn record is the one way the
 * one-record-per-line format above can break — free text never breaks
 * it — and it is the residual this primitive does not model (§3.11).
 * Through `appendAuditRecord` the descriptor carries `O_NONBLOCK`, but
 * only a regular file survives the verdict and `O_NONBLOCK` has no
 * effect on regular-file `write(2)` (POSIX), so the
 * reachable instance is a mid-write `ENOSPC` on a regular file, and no
 * act on the writer side repairs a line already at rest: the consumer of
 * the trail is the side that must refuse a final line carrying no
 * newline rather than parse it — a lossy fallback refuses what it cannot
 * process rather than answering a different, weaker question (§3.10).
 *
 * The write-all property is pinned at the SEAM rather than through this
 * function (§3.12). A short write is not stageable through
 * `appendAuditRecord` — only a regular file reaches the write, where the
 * non-blocking flag is inert, so staging one would need a filesystem
 * filled mid-write on a test host — but "cannot return without writing
 * everything, or raise" is a property of `writeRecordLine` alone, and a
 * non-blocking descriptor ON A PIPE stages it in one call. That is why
 * the write is a named export rather than an inline call, the same
 * device the recovery arms use to reach `recoveryFor` directly and the
 * sink verdict uses for its root-only dimensions.
 *
 * "Never throw" reaches the close. `closeSync` reports delayed-write
 * failures (`EIO`, `ENOSPC`, a network filesystem), and a throw out of a
 * `finally` REPLACES the return the block was already carrying — the
 * `return false` this posture owes its caller included — escaping into
 * the extension factory that calls the load-marker site and aborting
 * extension load, the fail-closed outcome the `audit-append` row denies.
 * So the success path closes INSIDE the guarded region, where a failed
 * close degrades open like any other write failure, and the `finally`
 * closes only the descriptor a failed write left behind, guarded because
 * a second failure on an already-reported append has nothing to add.

 * verdict, and surfaces the refusal it returns — cause and recovery both —
 * as one audit record. The hazard is one hazard, so it has one spelling.
 *
 * The recovery is arm-scoped (§3.11): the type/link/owner shapes are
 * hostile-input class and get the terse general act (make the path a
 * fresh plain file), while a loose mode alone is honest-mistake
 * reachable — a sink pre-created `0644` keeps its bits, since the
 * `0600` create mode binds only at creation — and names the one live
 * act, `chmod 600`. Naming `chmod` while the type or owner dimension
 * also fails would prescribe a dead act, so it is named only when the
 * mode is all that failed.
 *
 * Both recovery clauses are COMMAND context — text the clause invites
 * the operator to paste — so the path rides the `"shell"` delimiter of
 * `quoted`, POSIX single quotes inside which a substitution-shaped
 * component is bytes rather than an execution (issue #53). The cause
 * keeps the JSON delimiter: it is read, never pasted, and the suite's
 * clause reader decodes exactly that production. The §3.11 division
 * stands unchanged — the cause stays content-free about the act, the
 * recovery names the act and the path it lands on.
 *
 * Where `process.geteuid` is absent (win32), the owner dimension is
 * unmeasurable in these terms and is SKIPPED rather than refused —
 * enumerated residual (§3.11): POSIX ownership does not model that
 * host's ACLs, and refusing every append there would move the row's
 * fail direction on a dimension no act on that host repairs.

 * The recovery live at THIS surface for the failure that actually

 * under the state root reaches here — the record append and the bind
 * advisory's TTL stamp alike — so the arms name the WRITE and its PATH,
 * never one caller's sink. Each arm names a different object to repair:
 *
 *   - the destination directory is absent — create it;
 *   - an ancestor of it is a plain file (`ENOTDIR`) — nothing can be
 *     created beneath a file, so the fix is at that component, never at
 *     the path the write named;
 *   - the destination directory refuses the create (`EACCES` with no
 *     write path measurable there) — that path cannot be made anything
 *     at all, so the fix is the directory's mode;
 *   - the filesystem has no room for the write (`ENOSPC`, `EDQUOT`) —
 *     the object is that filesystem's free space or this account's
 *     quota, and nothing at the write path is misconfigured;
 *   - the mount refuses writes (`EROFS`) — the object is the mount; no
 *     mode at the write path admits the write while it holds;
 *   - the device or transport failed (`EIO`) — no act at the write path
 *     recovers a write the filesystem has already refused, so the
 *     message names the filesystem's health and stops there rather than
 *     prescribing a repair that would not have helped;
 *   - the write path itself is unusable — make it a plain, owner-writable
 *     file. This is the general arm, and the arms above exist so that it
 *     is reached only where that path really is the object that failed
 *     (a directory, a symlink, another account's file).
 *
 * The last three arms are the DELAYED-WRITE class the fail posture above
 * routes here: `closeSync` reports a write the filesystem accepted and
 * then refused, so those codes arrive at this function by that path as
 * well as from the open. They are arms rather than enumerated residuals
 * because each has an act an operator can perform, and the general arm's
 * act — make the path a plain writable file — is dead for all of them:
 * it is already one.
 *
 * The arms above are the modelled objects; every other code reaches the
 * general arm carrying its message. What decides whether that message is
 * honest is a RULE, stated here rather than a roster of the shapes it
 * generates, because the roster is what a later code silently falsifies
 * (§2.4, §3.11): the general arm's act — make the path a plain,
 * owner-writable file — is live exactly when the write path is the object
 * that failed. Every unmodelled failure whose object lies elsewhere
 * carries a dead act, and what it delivers is the cause alone; the write
 * still degrades open, with no repair named that would have helped. Such
 * a shape earns an arm when it acquires an act an operator can perform at
 * a named object, and not before.
 *
 * Exported for the arms that measure the routing directly. A shape whose
 * failure no honest check can stage on a test host — no filesystem is
 * filled, no mount is remounted, no device is broken (§3.12) — is still
 * owed a pin on which recovery it selects, and that pin is a call.
