/**
 * Session-start bind advisory — the tier-2 arming detector (SPEC §5.2
 * advisory state set, §5.9 read-only detector rule, §4.6 detector
 * placement).
 *
 * The detector reproduces the consumer's RESOLUTION and not the consumer's
 * EXECUTION: it answers from the configuration git itself resolves
 * (`core.hooksPath`, every scope merged — what fires is what git resolves)
 * and the layout the adapters derive from it (`<top>/.githooks`), running
 * no program of the repository it is classifying. A classifier that
 * executed what it classifies would not be the read-only surface §5.2
 * places it in.
 *
 * Placement (§4.6): the repository the advisory speaks about is the one
 * the SESSION stands in, resolved through `git rev-parse --show-toplevel`
 * from the session cwd — never `locateRepoRoot()`, whose realpath
 * resolution follows a symlinked install back to the real tree and would
 * classify the wrong clone (a linked worktree must be classified at ITS
 * top, where the adapters resolve). `locateRepoRoot()` names, with no test
 * seam set, the state root the TTL stamp lands under, since
 * `resolveStateRoot()` derives it from that same root. So the two are
 * rooted differently on purpose: the state root is INSTALL-rooted, while
 * the stamp's NAME within it is keyed to the repository classified above
 * (`bindAdvisoryStampPath`). They no longer need to coincide, and issue
 * #125 is what disproved the premise that they always did — one
 * shell-owned state root stands behind every repository a checkout is
 * invoked against (§5.5's fall-through disposition), so a debounce keyed
 * on that root alone let a session in one repository spend another's.
 *
 * The module's own READ of the TTL stamp goes through `readGatedFile`: open
 * the path under `audit.ts`'s guard flags, then require a plain regular file
 * inside a size cap OF THE DESCRIPTOR that open returned. The child timeout
 * bounds only SPAWNED children, and this process's own read has nothing to
 * reap — an unguarded open on a FIFO (or a symlink to one) at a read path
 * parks session start indefinitely, and a huge blob allocates against it.
 *
 * The WRITE side is split by what each component can be. The DIRECTORY
 * components — the state root's container and the state root — are
 * lstat-refused when they are links, because `mkdirSync(…, {recursive:
 * true})` follows a directory-level link and a link at the root routes the
 * stamp into the planter's directory; they are created with an owner-only
 * mode, since this writer is ordinarily the first to materialize the
 * shell's namespace and no later run tightens what it minted (§5.5). The
 * stamp LEAF is not probed and then written: it is OPENED under
 * `audit.ts`'s exported guard flags and its descriptor held to that
 * module's `fstat` verdict — one decision on the inode actually opened,
 * which refuses a hard link, a foreign owner and a group- or other-readable
 * mode alike, beside the link and the FIFO (the shape a link probe cannot see
 * and an unguarded write PARKS on, with no child for the timeout to reap)
 * that the flags themselves refuse one step earlier. Nothing
 * destructive rides that open — the emptying is an `ftruncate` AFTER the
 * verdict, because `O_TRUNC` would act inside `open(2)` and empty the very
 * object the verdict then refuses.
 *
 * Refusal is therefore RECORDED rather than swallowed wherever the sink is
 * reachable, since a swallowed refusal leaves the debounce dead for every
 * later session. Where it is NOT reachable — a symlinked state root or its
 * container, refused before the directory is made — the refusal is silent,
 * because the record would have to be appended through the very component
 * being refused; that is the silence the sibling writer chooses too.
 * The guard flags DECIDE inside `open(2)` itself: a link at the leaf raises
 * `ELOOP` and a reader-less FIFO raises `ENXIO`, so for exactly the two
 * shapes the flags were added for, no descriptor ever reaches the verdict and
 * a record composed only from the verdict is composed nowhere. The open's
 * site composes the same cause/recovery pair from the ERROR — through
 * `audit.ts`'s `recoveryFor`, the vocabulary the sibling writer already
 * speaks, so one hazard keeps one spelling across both writers — and the
 * verdict's site keeps composing its own. Components ABOVE the state root are
 * not this writer's to own and are deliberately unguarded (the seam's own
 * admissible-target policy, §5.5).
 *
 * Fail direction: the advisory is observability, never enforcement
 * (§4.5 report-don't-mutate). Every failure — no git, a non-zero or killed
 * child, an unwritable stamp — degrades to SILENCE and never throws into
 * the session_start handler.
 * The TTL stamp is written only after a SUCCESSFUL compute
 * (stamp-after-success, §5.9), under `resolveStateRoot()`'s root, so a
 * failed compute retries at the next session instead of going quiet for a
 * TTL it never earned.

 * The debounce stamp's path, keyed by the repository the advisory

 * §5.5's disposition is fall-through, so one shell-owned state root stands
 * behind every repository this checkout is invoked against, while the

 * on the state root alone the two disagree, and a session in a repository
 * the shell does not govern spends the debounce belonging to one it does —
 * §5.2's obligation to surface a degraded state at the next session start
 * then goes undischarged for the whole TTL window.
 *
 * The key is a digest of the repository's PHYSICAL top, not the path
 * itself: a path is not a file name, and the two properties wanted here
 * are exactly what a digest gives — bounded length whatever the path's
 * depth, and no component of a caller-influenced path reaching the joined
 * name. It is a keying function and never a security claim; a collision
 * costs one suppressed advisory, which is the cost this whole change is
 * about and not a new one. The physical top is what `computeBindState`
 * already compares against, so two spellings of one repository share a
 * debounce rather than each keeping their own (§4.6).
 *
 * This relocation takes §4.6's legacy-floor carve-out: the stamp is a
 * suppression token, so its stale copy is itself the fault, and the old
 * unkeyed leaf is not read at all. The ground is recorded here because the
 * carve-out requires it at the relocated datum's definition. Concretely,
 * consulting that leaf would re-spend — for one TTL window in every
 * repository — exactly the debounce this keying exists to separate; the
 * cost of not consulting it is one extra advisory, the direction §5.2
 * wants. The orphaned leaf is left inert rather than reaped, per the same
