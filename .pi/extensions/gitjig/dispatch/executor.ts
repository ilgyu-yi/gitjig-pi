/**
 * Dispatch executor — the delegate-agnostic bounded child (SPEC §4.9;
 * §3.10's outcome classes decided by the caller from this run shape).
 *
 * The delegate is an argv child (never a shell string) with cwd pinned to
 * the provisioned tree; the parent environment passes through with two
 * edits — the repo-locating and config-injection `GIT_*` families
 * (`GIT_DIR` / `GIT_WORK_TREE` / `GIT_INDEX_FILE` /
 * `GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY` / `GIT_COMMON_DIR`, and
 * `GIT_CONFIG_PARAMETERS` / `GIT_CONFIG_COUNT`) are
 * DELETED, because git resolves those ahead of cwd and an inherited one
 * retargets every delegate git write at the caller repository despite
 * the pinned cwd, or injects arbitrary config into the delegate's git
 * children (§1.5), and the ONE state seam is rebound —
 * `GITJIG_TEST_STATE_ROOT=<scratch>/state`
 * (§5.5's disposable-root carve-out, pointed inside the scratch so the
 * delegate's state dies with the dispatch). Both streams are drained
 * UNRECORDED: no delegate stream byte is held anywhere it could later
 * cross a return or failure channel (§4.9's content-free channels; the
 * drain also keeps a flooding delegate off the kernel-buffer wedge).
 *
 * Two timers, one phase each (the measured race class this split
 * closes): the kill timer bounds the RUN and is cleared the moment the
 * child exits — an orphaned grandchild can hold the pipes open past the
 * child's death, and a kill timer still armed during the flush grace
 * would mark an in-bound run timed out; from exit the grace timer bounds
 * the FLUSH, deciding from what has arrived when "close" never comes
 * (§5.9's hung-dependency terms). A spawn failure surfaces as
 * `spawnFailed` so the caller can refuse on §3.10's delegate-absent
 * class rather than conflate it with a failed run. The child is spawned
 * detached and the bound kills its whole process group. Named residual
 * (§3.11): a double-forked, re-setsid'd grandchild survives any group
 * kill on this platform and inherits the passthrough environment —
 * named, not claimed closed. The group kill fires on the timeout path
 * alone: a delegate-spawned child surviving a normal exit or a
 * post-spawn error is not group-killed, inherits the passthrough
 * environment, and outlives the scratch's removal.
