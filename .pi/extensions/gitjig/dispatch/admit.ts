/**
 * Dispatch admission — the bounded structured return, admitted on output
 * validity alone (SPEC §3.10; §4.9's sole-crossing clause).
 *
 * The one crossing is `<scratch>/return.json`. Admission demands: a
 * REGULAR FILE at the slot — the type verdict rides `lstat`, which does
 * not follow symlinks, so a FIFO (whose blocking open would freeze this
 * synchronous admit inside the extension host), a device, a directory,
 * or a symlinked slot refuses without ever being opened; at most
 * 64 KiB — an oversize return is refused WHOLE, never truncated into an
 * admission; strict JSON; the CLOSED schema
 * `{ ok: boolean, summary: string, reviewedHead?: string }` with unknown
 * keys refused — a minimum-match would admit a surface no contract
 * bounds. Anything the delegate printed on a stream is not the crossing
 * (§3.10's wrong-stream class lands here as a missing return).
 *
 * Every refusal cause below is a FIXED literal (§3.9's content-free
 * refusal records): no delegate byte, no operand, no filesystem detail
 * ever rides a cause. The five §3.10 outcome classes map onto them —
 * delegate absent and failed run and bound exceeded are decided by the
 * caller from the run shape; junk, partial, and wrong-stream land on the
 * two return-side causes here.
