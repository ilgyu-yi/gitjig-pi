/**
 * The dispatch instrument — `gitjig_dispatch` (SPEC §4.9 "The delegation
 * layer"; issue #88). `runDispatch` is the composed pipeline — provision
 * → run → admit → compare → operand scan → cleanup in `finally` — and
 * `registerDispatchTool` wraps it as the registered tool: one home, many
 * call sites (§4.9).
 *
 * The caller acts §1.4/§1.6/§1.7/§1.8 assign ride this dispatcher; where
 * a §3.3 row consumes the property, the dispatcher is a CALL SITE of the
 * predicate that row owns, never a second implementation (§3.11). The
 * named instance: holding and comparing the expected head is evidence
 * production for the §3.3 `merge-review` row. With the tree pinned at
 * provision, the compare consumes the return's `reviewedHead` and crosses
 * back as VALIDITY alone — byte-equal to the held hash → `"confirmed"`;
 * mismatch, absent, or unconfirmable → `"invalid"`, never an approve —
 * and neither operand ever enters the tool result, the outcome, or the
 * audit trail (§4.9's content-free return channels; §1.6's blind
 * compare). The mechanical outgoing-surface scan enforces the same rule
 * on the admitted summary: every hex run of ≥ 4 chars (either case) is
 * lowercased, and the return is refused whole with a fixed cause iff the
 * held hash contains the run or the run contains the held 7-prefix (§4.9
 * grounding in §3.9's content-free idiom; a paraphrased or re-encoded
 * operand is §4.9's injectable-context residual, not this scan's catch —
 * and the containment branch covers the held 7-prefix embedded in a
 * longer run, not an arbitrary interior slice padded into one, which
 * rides the same residual).
 *
 * Every dispatch act — admission and each refusal — lands at least one
 * `category:"dispatch"` record through the landed audit writer,
 * content-free: outcome and scratch-relative locators only (§5.5; the
 * sink itself fails open per §3.9's `audit-append` row, so a refusal
 * stands whether or not its record landed). Cleanup degrades OPEN: an
 * unremovable scratch warns on the audit trail and never converts a
 * decided outcome into a failure (§3.9).
 *
 * The composed tool result is a FRAME plus a DELIMITED PAYLOAD (issue
 * #97). The dispatcher's own verdict tokens are composed from its own
 * bytes — a boolean and a closed verdict union — and the delegate's
 * summary crosses back through `quoted()`, the same escaper every other
 * operator surface in this tree uses. Admission bounds the summary's size
 * and its schema and scans it for the held operand; none of those
 * constrains a BYTE of it, so before the escape a summary opening with a
 * line break spelled a second, well-formed `dispatch admitted … compare
 * confirmed` line inside the text reporting the real outcome — §3.10's
 * own sentence, that a write the guard permits must not be able to forge
 * the guard's decisions, applied to the guard whose decision is the
 * compare. Escaped, the payload is one line, carries no control byte, and
 * sits inside quotes that mark its exact extent, so a reader separates
 * what the dispatcher said from what the delegate did. The rendering is
 * reversible — the payload group decodes back to the delegate's bytes —
 * because the contract is inertness, not concealment.
 *
 * What that leaves unmodeled (§3.11): the escape closes line-forging and
 * the control classes `quoted()` enumerates, and closes nothing about the
 * summary's CONTENT. A delegate can still write false prose — a summary
 * claiming a review passed, spelled without a line break, is admitted and
 * rendered faithfully, because it is a claim and not a forged frame. The
 * frame is what this closes; the claim inside the payload is the reader's
 * to weigh, and §4.9's injectable-context residual already carries it.
