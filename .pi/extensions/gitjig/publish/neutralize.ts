/**
 * Egress neutralization — relayed platform side effects made inert (SPEC
 * §3.3 "Neutralization"; §3.6's worked application; issue #83 AC2).
 *
 * Runs on its own pattern set — mention shapes are not secret patterns.
 * Each actionable shape is transformed WHOLE to a backtick-wrapped
 * spelling, so republished text cannot page uninvolved parties or drive
 * the platform's auto-close channel (§3.7(e), §3.11's auto-close
 * essential): `@`-mentions, close-keyword + issue-reference pairs in
 * their case and separator variants (whitespace and the colon trailer),
 * `GH-N` forms, URL-form issue references, and cross-repository
 * `owner/repo#N` references.
 *
 * One shape stays live as the recorded decision (§3.3): the bare
 * same-repository `#N` — the pointer idiom §5.1 commits every durable
 * artifact to.
 *
 * The wrap is delimiter-length-aware because CommonMark pairs a code
 * span's opener with the next backtick run of EQUAL length: each pass
 * wraps with a run one backtick longer than the longest run in the text
 * it lands in (recomputed per pass — earlier passes insert backticks),
 * space-padded inside per CommonMark's own padding rule, and separated
 * by a space from any adjacent body backtick, whose touching run would
 * otherwise merge with the delimiter and leave no span. Measured ground
 * for both rules: a fixed single-backtick wrap paired with a stray body
 * backtick and rendered the shape live, and a delimiter touching a body
 * backtick merged runs so no span formed. Entity-encoded spellings are
 * refused as a device here: `&#64;`-style escapes decode back into the
 * text nodes reference filters scan.
 */

/**
 * The wrap passes, in application order: longer shapes first, so the
 * common case of a narrower pattern re-matching inside an already
 * wrapped span does not arise. Where a narrower pattern can still match
 * inside a wrapped shape's text (an `@` inside a URL form), the
 * per-pass delimiter rule makes the double wrap err inert — the outer
 * pair still closes around it.
