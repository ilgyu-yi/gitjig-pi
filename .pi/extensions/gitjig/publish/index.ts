/**
 * The egress publish instrument — the `gitjig_publish` tool (SPEC §3.3
 * "egress publish-boundary semantics"; the class row's tier-1 home;
 * issue #83). Registration only: the factory-legal surface, called from
 * the extension entry at load.
 *
 * Flow per call: destination admission → secret scan → on clean,
 * neutralization → the bounded executor. Every refusal lands exactly one
 * `category:"egress"` audit record and a tool result carrying validity
 * alone — disposition, pattern IDs, line locators — never the matched
 * text and never the body (§3.8's refusal-record rule; §4.9's measured
 * ground: a registered tool's result enters the run's transcript, so a
 * result a composer may relay stays content-free about what the refusal
 * withheld). A scan machinery failure (`PatternSourceError`) refuses
 * fail-closed on its own content-free cause (§3.9
 * `egress-publish-patterns`) — never the out-of-domain disposition, and
 * never a publish. The audit sink itself fails open (§3.9
 * `audit-append`): a refusal stands whether or not its record landed.
