/**
 * State-root resolution — RESOLUTION ONLY (SPEC §5.5, §4.6).
 *
 * With no seam set, the operational root `<repo>/.gitjig/state/` is
 * computed and returned without creating anything: operational-root
 * creation lands with the first operational writer (§6.1
 * build-as-consumed), not here.
 *
 * The single override seam `GITJIG_TEST_STATE_ROOT` is the only
 * environment variable that configures the runtime's own behavior; the
 * name marks it test-only, and an active seam is reported
 * (`seamActive: true`) so the entry can announce it (§5.9). The other
 * named env-value reads in the runtime (`.pi/extensions/`) — `PATH`, `HOME`,
 * `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`, and `GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM` in bind-state.ts's
 * `childEnv()` — are read only to compose a child process's
 * environment: the only branches on them decide what is copied onto
 * the child — whether the key is set at all, or the empty string in
 * place of an unset value. Their values still reach outcomes through
 * that child — bind-state.ts's `childEnv()` docstring records that the
 * classifier's verdict follows `HOME` and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` by design
 * — so they are passthroughs, not configuration seams.
 *
 * Fail posture (§3.9, `seam-target` row): a seam that is set but
 * unusable — empty, relative, missing, or not a directory — REFUSES the
 * run. Falling back would write the operational evidence surface from a
 * test context, exactly what §5.5 forbids. "Set" is decided on presence
 * alone, so an empty value is present-and-unmeasurable and refuses like
 * any other unusable value; only an UNSET seam takes the fail-open arm
 * and returns the operational root with `seamActive: false`.
 *
 * Every refusal names its own live recovery (§3.11), because the
 * surrounding substrate otherwise offers the operator only a total
 * extension-layer disarm.
 *
 * The seam target is measured with ONE probe. Measured with two —
 * `existsSync` then `statSync` — a target that stopped being measurable
 * between them made the second probe throw a raw filesystem error, and
 * `resolveStateRoot` is called at extension-factory scope, so that error
 * escaped the same way a refusal does but carrying neither this module's
 * refusal text nor its `RECOVERY` string, the remediation every arm here
 * otherwise owes. The two probes answered the same question and produced
 * the same refusal, so collapsing them closes the window rather than
 * enumerating it: missing, not a directory, and refused are one answer,
 * and every one of them refuses with the recovery attached.
