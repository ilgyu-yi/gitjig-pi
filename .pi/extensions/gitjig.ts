/**
 * gitjig tier-1 runtime — extension entry (SPEC §3.2, §4.1, §4.6, §5.5).
 *
 * The factory performs registrations only: pi action methods are illegal
 * during extension loading, so everything that talks to the session runs
 * inside the `session_start` handler. The load marker is a plain-fs
 * append (legal at load) and the load site degrades open: a marker-write
 * failure warns and continues, never aborts extension load (§3.9,
 * `audit-append` row). `resolveStateRoot` is deliberately NOT wrapped —
 * an unusable seam refuses the run (fail closed, `seam-target` row).
 *
 * Because the audit sink fails open, whether it is live is itself
 * evidence: every append outcome of the session is folded into
 * `auditWritable` on the durable `gitjig-registration` entry, so a reader
 * of the session record can tell a live sink from a dead one instead of
 * having to have watched the console (§3.9, §5.9). This is observability
 * only — the fail direction stays open (§3.8).
